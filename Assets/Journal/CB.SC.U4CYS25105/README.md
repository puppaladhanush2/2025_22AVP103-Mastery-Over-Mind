# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

Scenario 1 (after joining campus)

After coming here, I had a lot of self-doubts about myself. Everything was new: the place, people, environment, and even the language. I used to overthink whether I could adjust or be able to make friends or turn out to be lonely. But as days passed, I realized how lucky I truly am to have found my roommates. They are not just people I live with; they have been my support system, my small family away from home. They are understanding, caring, and so supportive, though separated by language and from slightly different backgrounds. Somehow, despite the differences, our hearts connected so naturally that now I just cannot imagine my days without them. Each of them has a unique personality, adding color and meaning to my life.
Harshitha, for instance, is the sweetest and most disciplined among us. She wakes me up every morning with her cheerful smile and soft voice, no matter how sleepy she might be herself. That simple gesture of hers makes my mornings so much better. She never forgets to greet the day with positivity, and her energy makes me feel calm and motivated. Whenever I struggle with my subjects, Harshitha is always the first to step forward and help me patiently. She explains concepts until I completely understand them, never making me feel bad for asking too many questions. Indeed, I admire her patience and dedication. She constantly encourages me to do better and reminds me to believe in myself. Another thing that connects us is our love for music. We often listen to songs in different languages — sometimes in Tamil, sometimes in Telugu, Hindi, or even Korean. We may not know every lyric, but we enjoy the rhythm and emotion together. There are evenings when we just sit on our beds, singing along loudly, laughing at our own mispronunciations, and forgetting all our worries for a while. Those are the moments I cherish the most: simple yet so warm.
Then, there is Nethra, who is probably the most energetic and lively person I have ever come across. She has this amazing ability to sense whenever I am feeling low, even if I try to hide it. Whenever I feel alone, homesick, or just tired from everything, she somehow manages to lift my mood instantly. Her presence is like a burst of sunshine in my gloomy moments. She is always smiling, cracking jokes, and spreading positive vibes wherever she goes. Nethra has this natural charm that makes everyone around her feel comfortable. She never lets me stay sad for too long — even if I try to sulk, she’ll make sure I end up laughing within minutes. I share everything with her — from my random thoughts to my biggest worries — and she listens with so much care. Talking to her always makes my heart feel lighter. She reminds me that it’s okay to have bad days and that life is too short to take everything too seriously. Her way of cheering me up is unique — sometimes she tells funny stories, sometimes she drags me to go for a walk or dance to loud music, and sometimes she simply sits quietly beside me, letting me feel her silent support. It is comforting beyond words. She is truly one of the reasons that I have grown more confident and emotionally strong since coming here.
And then there's Mansi - the heart of our group. She's what I call the "girly girl," full of excitement, laughter, and life. She has this bright, bubbly personality that makes everyone smile without even trying. I genuinely enjoy every single moment spent with her because she makes everything fun. Whether it’s dressing up for college, taking random pictures, going for snacks, or just lying down and talking for hours, Mansi finds joy in every little thing. She’s expressive, caring, and full of warmth. She often compliments everyone, spreads positivity, and keeps reminding us to enjoy the present. I really look up to her for being herself. She doesn’t hold herself back in voicing opinions, and that confidence has helped me, too. All inhibitions are gone when she’s around; I be myself without any fear of judgment. Her presence adds a spark to our room-the kind of energy that will make even an ordinary day special. She gets me to dress up, smile more, and love myself exactly the way I am. And there's never going to be a single boring moment when she's around, and believe me, this is something for which I consider myself extremely lucky.
One of the most memorable days with my roommates was my birthday last month. It was right in the middle of our mid-semester exams, and honestly, I wasn’t expecting any celebration. I was missing my parents terribly that day. I remember sitting quietly, thinking how strange it felt to spend my birthday away from home for the first time. I was feeling low, trying to distract myself by studying, when something unexpected happened. That evening, Harshitha called me to the common area saying she needed help with something. When I walked in, I was completely shocked — the lights were dim, and suddenly they all shouted, “Happy Birthday!” The room was decorated with balloons and handmade charts. They had even arranged a small cake and some snacks. I was so overwhelmed that I couldn’t hold back my tears. I literally cried because I had never expected such love and effort from them, especially when everyone was so busy with exams. It was the purest and most touching surprise I could have asked for.
We clicked so many pictures, sang songs, danced, and laughed till midnight after cake cutting. That moment made me realize how close we had all become in such a short time. I didn’t feel homesick anymore because my roommates made me feel like I was right at home — just in a different version of it. The next weekend, we decided to go for a small outing to celebrate properly after our exams. It was one of the best days ever. We went to a nearby park and then to a café, took tons of pictures, shared food, and talked endlessly. I felt so happy and thankful that day because I knew I found the right people to share my journey with. I looked around at them laughing and teasing with each other, and I thought — this is my little family now. These experiences have taught me so much about friendship, care, and emotional connection. Before coming here, I thought making genuine friends in a new place would be difficult. But Harshitha, Nethra, and Mansi proved me wrong. They showed me that friendship doesn’t depend on how long you’ve known someone or whether you speak the same language fluently. It depends on understanding, effort, and genuine love. We may come from different regions and have different habits, but our bond goes beyond all that. We share everything — our joys, our frustrations, our secrets, our silly jokes, and even our food. Living with them has taught me patience, empathy, and how to enjoy the little moments in life. Now, when I look back, I feel proud of how far I’ve come — from being a shy, doubtful person to someone who feels confident, loved, and at home. My roommates have played a huge part in that transformation. They made me believe in myself again. Every night when we sit together chatting or laughing before bed, I silently thank life for giving me such amazing people. We started as strangers who barely understood each other’s language, but now we’re like sisters who share a bond which no words can describe. I’ll always be grateful for them because they turned what could have been a lonely experience into one filled with laughter, comfort, and unforgettable memories.

Scenario 2 (last week)

Everybody here makes fun of us, calling us "the Amirthas," because yes — my best friend's name is also Amirtha. It's quite a funny coincidence that both of us share not just the same name, but also a long journey together. We studied in the same school, Amrita Vidyalayam, and now by another beautiful twist of fate, both of us ended up joining Amrita College for our higher studies. Sometimes people laugh and ask, "How do you even manage with the same name?" But honestly, I feel proud of it. It makes our bond feel even more special, like we were destined to stay connected no matter where life takes us. Our friendship has grown stronger over the years, and she has become one of the most important people in my life.
Whenever I am feeling low, depressed, or at the edge of crying, she is the first person I want to talk to. Any time of the day, whatever she may be doing, she makes time for me. She never judges me or tells me my problems are small. All she does is listen patiently to every word that comes out of my mouth, and that in itself comforts me so much. Sometimes, all I need is for somebody to hear me out without giving advice, and she knows exactly when to speak and when to let me cry. Days in college can be too overwhelming, especially when misunderstandings, pressure, or loneliness takes over, and talking to her seems to be my safe place. I have learned well by now that not everyone gets a friend like her, someone who understands with very few words.
Last week was one of those moments. I felt so down, knowing a few misunderstandings were taking place amongst my friends. I felt I couldn’t trust anyone in my department, and I just wanted to let everything out. Without hesitation, I called her up and told her all about everything that had happened and how it felt. She didn’t interrupt me or judge me; instead, she just listened attentively and consoled me. After I was done, she spoke with composure and advised me so that the whole thing looked different to me. She told me not to lose peace because of temporary problems and that I am much stronger than what I usually feel myself to be. It stayed with me for days. She’s always known exactly what to say to make me feel fine. Although we are in different departments, it never seems like a distance between us.
Sometimes, I wish she was in my department, too. I would then imagine how fun it would be to attend the same classes, work together on projects, or even sit beside her during boring lectures. But maybe it's because we are in different departments that our bond stays so fresh and exciting. Every time we meet, we have so many new stories to share — about our classmates, teachers, and all those funny incidents that happen in our respective departments. It's like living two different college lives and yet still being able to stay connected with each other.
Recently, on her birthday, I got an opportunity to make her feel as special as she makes me feel every day. Along with her CSE department friends, we planned a small surprise for her. We decorated her room, arranged a cake, and brought some snacks. When she walked in and saw everything, the look on her face was so priceless — she genuinely looked surprised and emotional. We all sang and danced and laughed together. We partied till 1 a.m. that night, and it was one of the most enjoyed nights I have ever had in college. For a few hours, whatever problems we had vanished, and it felt like we were back in school again — without any tension or stress, but full of happiness. By just looking at her, who is always smiling, makes me really happy. I realized how much she really means to me and how important her happiness is.
She is a bit different from me in personality, honestly-not exactly my "type" or "vibe." I'm more quiet and reserved, while she's lively, outgoing, and always full of energy. But maybe that's what makes our friendship so perfect: they say opposites attract, and I think that's us. She brings color and brightness into my calm and simple world. She pulls me out of my comfort zone and helps me experience life with more enthusiasm. And in return, I give her emotional balance and peace whenever she feels low. We balance each other beautifully.
Our friendship goes back to school times. We have shared so many memories — from whispering in class during lectures to laughing uncontrollably over the silliest of jokes. Even now, when we talk about those old days, we cannot believe how much we have changed and how nothing has changed after all. Every day, we still talk about everything: the latest gossip at college, small updates in our life, or simply random thoughts that cross our minds. There’s never a dull moment when I’m with her. I can completely be myself — no pretending, no fear of being judged. She knows all my flaws and still loves me just the same. That’s the kind of comfort that only true friendship can give.
Sometimes, I really wish she could be my roommate next year. I visualize us studying together late into the night, watching movies, sharing food, or simply talking until we fall asleep. It would be an extension of our friendship into our daily life in a closer way. Really, I hope that wish comes true because I know living with her would make my college days even more memorable. We also share a lot of stories from our lives-the good, the bad, and everything in between. There are times when she feels demotivated or starts doubting herself. I can easily sense it from her tone or texts. Whenever that happens, I try to be there for her the same way she's always been there for me. I tell her that it's okay to take breaks and that one bad day doesn't define her. I remind her of how strong and capable she is. Seeing her smile again after being upset makes me feel proud that I could make a small difference in her day. What's even more beautiful is that with time, all her department friends have become close to me too. They treat me like one of their own. At times, I feel more comfortable with them than with some of my own department friends. Isn't it funny how her world slowly became mine too? We've all spent time with each other, sharing jokes, study sessions, and food. They all know about our bond and tease us for being inseparable often; well, I take that as a compliment. One of the most special memories we created in recent times was our train journey back home. We both decided to travel together, and those few hours felt magical. We listened to songs, shared snacks, took pictures, and laughed endlessly. The train journey was filled with nostalgia, reminding us how far we've come from school days to being college students now-yet still the same two girls who can't stop talking and laughing together. I remember looking at her during that trip and just feeling grateful. Life changes so fast, but some people remain constant, like a comforting anchor. When I think about our friendship, it's like, well, it's not just a bond, it's a way of being. She knows me in ways no one else does. We grew up together, supported each other through different phases of our lives, and are continuing to make more memories every day. I honestly don't want this friendship to ever end, even when life takes us wherever after college. People laugh and say, "Here come the Amirthas," but for me, it's much more than a mere coincidence-it's destiny, and I will be grateful forever to have her by my side.

Scenario 3 (last week)

Another person whom I really feel thankful to have in my life is Amirtha’s roommate, Lakshana. When I first met her, I didn't know that she would become such an important part of my college journey. At first glance, she appeared to be a very calm and quiet girl — someone who doesn’t talk much and prefers to stay in her own world. She had that gentle and peaceful aura around her that immediately made me feel comfortable. Over time, as we started spending more moments together, I realized that beneath her quiet personality lies a kind, caring, and deeply thoughtful person. These days, she has become much closer to me, and our bond keeps growing stronger with each passing week.
The interesting thing in our friendship is that we are not the same kind of people. Sometimes I feel our vibes match perfectly, and sometimes they don't-and it's alright that way. There are days when we connect deeply, laughing and talking over random things for hours, and other days when we just sit quietly, doing our own work in peace. But that's what makes this friendship so real and genuine. There's no pressure to always talk or always have fun, yet we understand each other's mood with not so many words. I really appreciate that balance because it keeps me relaxed in her company.
One of my favorite memories with her is our late-night study sessions. Almost every night, especially during exam times, we used to sit in the study room together — me, Amirtha, and Lakshana — our little trio that formed all of a sudden but feels like it’s been there forever. We would stay up till 1:30 a.m., sometimes even later, with our books open but also our conversations flowing endlessly. We talked, laughed, listened to music, teased each other, and yes — studied a little too. Those nights were full of energy, fun, and chaos. We’d make tea or coffee to keep ourselves awake, then get distracted by random topics, and before we knew it, it would be past midnight. Still, those moments are among the best memories I’ve made in college. It didn’t feel like just studying — it felt like a bonding ritual.
More than just a trio of friends, this trio – me, Amirtha, and Lakshana – turned into a small family here: we genuinely care about each other, stand by one another during every high and low, and always make sure that no one gets left behind or lonely. The moment any one of us feels sad or tired, the other two just jump in to lighten up the mood. I can very confidently say that these two girls keep me away from feeling stressed or alienated in college. We are always available for one another – be it to share snacks, help in assignments, rant about problems, or simply sit together in silence.
Lakshana, especially, gives me that "bestie" vibe: somebody I can rely on and just be myself with. Although our personalities are quite opposite, somehow we always seem to fit together. She has this comforting aura that people are safe and heard when being around her. She is the type of person who doesn't talk much, but whatever she says means something. I like that about her. So soft yet so strong, so gentle yet so determined. She motivates people around her with her silence, unconsciously.
Food is one thing that defines our friendship. We all share snacks constantly; in fact, it has become like a daily ritual for our trio. Whenever we go to the canteen, we always end up buying a lot of food compared to what we could eat. We cannot help but say, “Let’s buy this too,” then the other adds another one, and by the end, we have full plates on the table. I am a complete foodie; I never say no to food, but even I reach my limit sometimes. Yet, they always make me eat, saying, “Come on, you can finish it!” It turns into a mini laughter session every single time. These small and silly moments mean so much because they make college life lighter and happier.
Then came her birthday — another unforgettable day. We planned a small celebration with cake, snacks, and music. Everything started smoothly, but of course, like any fun birthday, it didn’t stay that way for long. The moment we cut the cake, someone smeared a bit on her face, and within seconds, the whole thing turned into a cake-smearing war! Before I knew it, everyone was laughing and throwing pieces of cake at each other. But somehow, out of everyone there, I ended up with the most cake on my face! It was hilarious — my face was completely covered, while Lakshana had only a few spots of cream. We laughed so hard that tears rolled down our cheeks. It was messy,and absolutely perfect. That night, I realized how happy and comfortable I feel with her and Amirtha — it truly felt like being with family.
Being with Lakshana and CSE department friends gives me such a homely feeling. I've never once felt out of place with them. They include me in everything — whether it’s study discussions, random conversations, or simple daily plans. With them, there’s always laughter, comfort, and a sense of belonging. I sometimes look around and feel genuinely lucky to have found such people. What really makes Lakshana special is her motivation. She's that kind of friend who would push me to do better, to be focused, and to believe in myself. She isn't loud or dramatic about it, but her way of motivating us is so natural. There are so many nights when both I and Amirtha start to sleep while studying, and she will say, "Come on, just one more topic, we can do this!" Her small words instantly boost our energy. The funny thing is, after motivating us, she is the first one to fall asleep! We always tease her for that, like "Look who's the first to sleep!" But deep down, we really appreciate her so much because she makes studying feel like teamwork, not pressure. She has this quiet determination that inspires me. Even though she doesn’t show it openly, I know that she deeply cares about her goals and about the people she loves. She reminds me that being calm doesn’t mean being weak — sometimes it’s the calm people who have the strongest hearts. I learn patience, kindness, and balance from her. Whenever I am with her, I feel more centered and peaceful. My trio has become one of the best things in my life here. The way we support and care for each other makes me feel truly blessed. Often, I feel that college life would not have been anything in my life without them. With them, every day seems much lighter, funnier, and full of meaning. From late-night studies to random outings to deep emotional talks, a collection of memories that I shall keep with me forever. I really wish that Lakshana remains my friend till the end of college, and even after our graduation. Some bonds are too precious to fade away with time, and ours, I believe, is one of them. Though people come and go in life, true friends stay, and I want her to be one of those who stay. I'm grateful for every laugh we've shared, every night we've studied together, and every word of comfort she has said. With her and Amirtha by my side, I feel like I have a small family in college, one which keeps me grounded, loved, and truly happy.
