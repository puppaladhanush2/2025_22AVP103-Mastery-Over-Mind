For Amma(Mata Amritanandamayi Devi),
   I'm deeply grateful to Amma and all the love and guidance that she brings into my life. Even though I haven’t met her in person, I feel her presence in every corner of the collge , quietly guiding me through everything I do. There’s something about her that’s beyond words this calm, loving energy that just makes you feel safe and calm.Whenever I think of Amma, there's this sense of calm that comes in. It’s not something that can be explained easily , it just feels like her presence is always around, guiding me through things. Even when I’m stressed or unsure, remembering her teachings somehow brings me back to balance. She has this rare kind of strength that’s peaceful, steady, and deeply reassuring.College life can be stressful at times — there are exams, projects, and all the small worries that pile up. But when I think of Amma, I’m reminded to slow down and focus on what really matters. She makes me realize that life isn’t just about marks or achievements; it’s about being a good human being. Her teachings remind me to stay kind, patient, and grounded even when things don’t go my way.Sometimes when I walk around campus and see her hear people talk about her, I feel this quiet warmth inside me. Amma’s love seems to fill the whole place(college), it makes the college feel more like home. There’s a peaceful energy here that feels like her blessing. It’s almost like she’s silently watching everyone (their actions and behaviour), guiding us without saying a word.What I love most about Amma is how simple her message is, love and serve others selflessly. It sounds so small, but it’s actually everything. Whenever I get upset or impatient, I remind myself of Amma’s calmness and words. She teaches me that strength doesn’t come from being powerful or strong,but staying grounded and humble.Even though I’ve never spoken to Amma, I feel connected to her. Sometimes, when I’m anxious or sad, I just close my eyes and think of her face. It’s strange how just that small thought makes my heart feel lighter. It feels like she’s silently saying, “Don’t worry, I’m here.” That kind of invisible strength is so special and needed.Amma’s teachings have also changed the way I look at success. She’s made me realize that being a good person is more important than being the best person. She reminds me that real growth isn’t just in knowledge but in kindness.Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to actually meet her. I think I wouldn’t even be able to say much — I’d probably just smile or cry and say thank you for everything she does. Because honestly, how do you thank someone who’s touched your life without even meeting you? She’s like a silent strength in my life always there, even when I don’t realize it.There’s a quote of Amma’s that I really love: “When love overflows and is expressed through every word and action, that is real devotion.” That line stays with me. It makes me want to bring that same love into the little things I do every day — helping someone without being asked, listening without judging, or just being more patient.life is about how we live, how we treat people, and how much love we put into what we do. That’s such a grounding thought, especially in a world that often feels busy and competitive. She reminds me that it’s okay to slow down, to breathe, and to choose kindness.

Writing this now, I realize how grateful I am to have Amma’s presence in my life, even from being far. She’s like the soft background that makes everything feel calm and balanced. Amma has helped me see that the real purpose of life is to be kind, to care, and to make others happy in whatever small ways we can.

So today, I just want to say thank you, Amma for all your love. Thank you for being a quiet source of strength, for reminding me to look beyond grades and achievements, and for helping me focus on becoming a better person every day. You make me want to live with more love, more patience, and more gratitude.



To Ramaguru sir,
  I feel really lucky to have a teacher like Ramaguru Sir in my life. His MAOM classes have become one of the most peaceful and jolly parts of my week. It’s not just a subject for me anymore ,it feels like a time to reconnect with myself and distract myself from everything thats happening in my life. There’s something about the way he teaches that just reaches us(students) deeply.Before I started attending his classes, I used to get stressed out easily. My thoughts would always be racing always worrying about assignments, deadlines, or just random things that didn’t even matter in the long run. I didn’t really know how to slow down or handle that mental chaos. But ever since I began learning under Ramaguru Sir, things have started to change in a quiet but powerful way(meditating).

His way of teaching has honestly made such a difference. When he guides us through meditation, it doesn’t feel like an exercise, it feels like a small journey inward which calms your mind and body. The way he speaks ,he's loud but in a good way that. He makes sure that the classes are fun but also relaxing making the class very engaging. I’ve noticed that after his classe, after completing the exercise. I approach things more calmly. Instead of reacting immediately when something goes wrong, I’ve learned to pause, breathe, and respond with a little more patience. That might sound simple, but for me, it’s a big change. His guidance has taught me that calmness is not about escaping problems; it’s about staying centered even when things aren’t perfect. I just dont do the meditation in class but i've continues doing it in my home.

What stands out most about Ramaguru Sir is that he doesn’t just teach meditation, which is very much required. You can see it in the way he talks, walks, and interacts with people. There’s this quiet confidence in his presence. Even when he’s explaining something simple, the way he does it makes you want to listen.In a world that’s always in a hurry, his classes feel like a pause button, a reminder that it’s okay to slow down. Through his sessions, I’ve started to understand that mindfulness isn’t just about sitting silently with your eyes closed; it’s about being aware in everything you do, eating, walking, listening, studying. He often says that meditation isn’t about controlling the mind but understanding it. That line really stayed with me. It made me realize how much time we spend running away from our thoughts instead of learning from them.Sometimes when I’m stressed or anxious outside class, I think about his voice guiding us to “just breathe.” It’s become like a small thought I can return to whenever I feel overwhelmed. I’ve started practicing short meditations on my own now, even for five or ten minutes a day. It helps me stay grounded and less reactive. I don’t think I would’ve developed that habit without his influence.

What I appreciate most about Ramaguru Sir is how simple he keeps everything. He doesn’t make meditation sound difficult. He makes it approachable.There’s also something incredibly genuine about him. You can tell he really believes in what he’s teaching and genuinely wants his students to feel peace within themselves. I think that’s what makes his presence so special — it’s not just knowledge he shares, it’s a part of his own calmness.I’ve learned that slowing down isn’t wasting time, it’s actually what helps me think clearly and make better decisions. These small shifts have made my days feel lighter, more meaningful, and less stressful.

Sometimes I wonder if he knows how much of an impact he has on his students. Because what he teaches might seem simple on the surface, but it really changes how you experience life. I find myself applying his lessons everywhere, when I’m nervous before an exam, when I’m dealing with people. His voice, his tone, that calm energy, it all stays with me.Now, when I think about meditation, I don’t think of it as a task or ritual anymore. It feels more like a way of living,being mindful, kind, and patient in whatever I do. That shift in mindset is something I’ll always be grateful for.I’ve also noticed how much the overall energy of our MAOM class has changed because of him. Everyone seems more relaxed and open. So today, I just want to say thank you to Ramaguru Sir, for being such a calm, steady presence in my life, and for showing me that peace isn’t something far away, but something I can create each day. Thank you for helping me find balance, for teaching me to breathe through the chaos.I may not always say it out loud, but I’m deeply thankful for everything I’ve learned from him.



To Harshini, Anushree and Kavya,
  When I think about the things I’m most grateful for in my college life, the first that comes to mind are my three wonderful friends. They’re the ones who make even the most ordinary days so special. Every laugh, every small conversation, and every shared meal with them has become a memory I’ll always cherish. Life just feels lighter and happier because of them.It’s funny how, when I first met them, I didn’t realize how important they would become. Over time, they’ve turned into such a huge part of my daily routine that I can’t imagine college without them. Whether it’s rushing to class, sitting together in the canteen, or walking back after a long day, everything feels better when they’re around. They bring me a mix of laughter, understanding, and warmth,that makes even stressful days feel okay.There have been so many times when I’ve felt tired, anxious, or even lonely. But somehow, they always seem to know when something’s wrong. They show up with a smile, a joke, or sometimes just a quiet presence that makes things feel lighter. I don’t think they even realize how much their support has meant to me. They’ve become my safe space — the people I can truly be myself with, without worrying about being judged.One of the things I’ll never forget is how they’ve helped me with my studies. I’ve always been the one with a hundred questions, asking for clarification or repeating the same doubt in five different ways. But they’ve never once made me feel silly for it. Instead, they’ve been patient, calm, and encouraging. Whether it’s explaining concepts again and again or staying up late to help me revise, they’ve been there every single time. Their patience and kindness have honestly helped me learn better and stay motivated, especially during stressful exam times.

And then, of course, there’s the food, one of my favorite parts of our friendship. They’ve shared their tiffin with me so many times, bringing delicious dishes from home that always make lunch breaks something to look forward to. It’s not just about the food itself (though it’s always amazing!), it’s the love behind it.We’ve shared so many laughs together too those random, unstoppable laughing fits that come out of nowhere and make everyone around us stare. Even a normal walk or a study session turns into something fun when we’re together. What I appreciate most about my friends is that they’re not just there for the fun moments, but also for the hard ones. They’ve seen me at my best and my worst, and they’ve never treated me differently. There have been days when I’ve felt like giving up or doubting myself, and they’ve been the ones who reminded me of what I’m capable of. They somehow know exactly what to say to make things feel okay again. Sometimes it’s advice, sometimes it’s just a smile,but it always helps.

I’ve learned so much from them, not just academically but personally too. They’ve shown me what true friendship means, being there for each other not only when things are good, but especially when they’re not. They’ve also taught me how small things, like listening or helping someone with a problem, can make a big difference.Friends are those people who turns out to be matured even in their teenage years.I can’t count how many times they’ve made me laugh when I wanted to cry or helped me find solutions when I felt stuck. They make every problem seem smaller just by being around. I honestly don’t know how I would have handled some of the tough days without them.College life can get stressful, but having friends like them makes all the difference. They remind me that I don’t have to face everything alone. Sometimes I wonder if I tell them enough how much they mean to me — probably not. So I want to say it here, in my gratitude journal, clearly and from the heart: I’m so thankful for them.

They’ve turned my routine days into something to look forward to. They’ve made me laugh till my stomach hurt, shared notes and food, cheered me up when I was down, and been my biggest supporters. Every memory with them,the serious talks, the random jokes, the silly moments — means so much to me.So, to my three amazing friends,thank you for being who you are. Thank you for all the laughter, the patience, the understanding, and the love. Thank you for standing by me, teaching me, feeding me, and making my days brighter. You’ve made my college journey so much more meaningful and joyful than I ever imagined.
