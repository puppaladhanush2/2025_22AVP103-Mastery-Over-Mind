## Journal Record
#First Scenario#
8th-August,2025
Mata Amritanandamayi
                    I would like to express my gratitude to our beloved Founder and Chairperson, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi. Amma has always been a source of love, strength, and inspiration for all of us. Her guidance has helped Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham grow into a place where education is not just about learning from books, but also about becoming a better human. Amma teaches us to live with kindness, honesty, and compassion. She reminds us that true education is about using our knowledge to help others and make the world a better place. Because of her blessings, we learn to face challenges with courage and to treat everyone with love and respect. We are deeply thankful to Amma for creating this wonderful institution where we can learn, grow, and serve. Her life and work continue to inspire us to do good and to stay humble, no matter how successful we become. With love and gratitude, we thank Amma for being our guiding light and for filling our lives with wisdom, peace, and care. We are truly blessed to be part of the Amrita family under her divine guidance.
#Second Scenario# 
August,2025
Bhavishya and Yasaswini
                        I feel truly grateful to have such wonderful roommates — Bhavishya and Yasaswini. Living together with them has been a really nice experience so far. The most surprising and happy coincidence is that Yasaswini was not only my classmate but also my college friend earlier. Knowing that someone familiar would be sharing this new journey with me made me feel comfortable and assured right from the start. It felt like life had arranged things perfectly. Both of my roommates have been very kind, understanding, and supportive. Bhavishya and I have grown to become good friends now. We did have a small fight once, but thankfully, it didn’t last long. We talked about it openly, cleared up our misunderstanding that very day, and everything went back to normal. That experience actually made our friendship even stronger, and I’m glad we both chose to understand each other instead of holding any grudges. I truly believe that the bond we share continues to stay the same throughout our four years on this campus. Having such good-hearted roommates makes hostel life so much better and more memorable. I’m thankful for them and for all the little moments we share every day.
#Third Scenario# 
September,2025
My friends
          I am truly grateful to have such amazing friends — Sathwika, Maneesha, Nethra, Harshitha, Amrita, Mansi, Aadi, Midun, Advik, and Sreekanth. Even though the time we spent together was short, it was filled with fun, laughter, and beautiful memories that I will always cherish. Each one of them has made my days more special in their own way. We have shared so many small yet meaningful moments — from simple conversations to group laughs — and those moments have made me feel really happy and connected. At first, I was quite sad when I got placed in Section B, while my roommates were in Section A. I felt a little lonely and unsure about how things would turn out. But during that time, I grew close to Sathwika, and our friendship slowly became stronger. I am really thankful to her for being there for me and for making me feel comfortable and supported.I hope that our friendship continues to grow stronger with time and that we all stay close without any misunderstandings or clashes. True friends are rare, and I feel blessed to have found such wonderful people in my life.
