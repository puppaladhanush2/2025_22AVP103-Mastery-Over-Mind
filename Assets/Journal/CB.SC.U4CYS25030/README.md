He helped me in learning all the basics of every topic of every subject that are helped me in the competitive exams that I faced, he was always been a source of positivity and support.

I admire his patience and willingness to help others without expecting anything in return. His guidance has inspired me to help others in the same way.

                 I am really thankful to dama srinivas sir, my physics lecture, form motivating me in improving my learning skills and believe in myself.
