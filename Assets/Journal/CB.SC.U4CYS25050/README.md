# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record
Scenario: Gratitude for My Mathematics Sir – Mr. Srinivasan


When I joined college in August 2025, everything felt new .the campus, the classes, and especially the subjects. Among all of them, the one that worried me the most was mathematics. I had always found maths difficult in school, and people kept saying that engineering maths would be even harder. So when the semester started, I was already nervous and unsure if I would be able to manage it.

Then I met Srinivasan sir, our mathematics teacher. From the very first class, I realized he wasn’t like most teachers I had before. The way he spoke and explained concepts made the subject feel lighter. He didn’t just write formulas on the board and expect us to memorize them. Instead, he took time to explain why those formulas worked and how they connected to real-life situations. His calm tone and simple way of teaching immediately made the atmosphere in class very comfortable.

One day in September 2025, he was teaching a topic on Differential Equations. I remember sitting there, struggling to understand the logic behind the steps. He noticed my confused face and gently asked if everything was clear. When I said I wasn’t fully getting it, he didn’t ignore it or move on. Instead, he stopped the lesson and explained it again using an everyday example about filling a water tank and the rate of water flow. Suddenly, the concept started to make sense. That small moment meant a lot to me because it showed how observant and caring he was toward his students.

What I admire most about Mr. Srinivasan is his patience and understanding nature. He never loses his temper or makes anyone feel small for not knowing something. If a student gives a wrong answer, he just smiles and says, “That’s a good try. Let’s think about it again.” This positive approach makes everyone feel comfortable asking doubts — even the ones we think are silly. Because of this, our class has become a space where we actually want to learn rather than just sit quietly and listen.

When the first internal exams approached, I was nervous again. I decided to revise by going through the notes he gave, and I was surprised at how easy they were to follow. His notes were simple, direct, and filled with small tips and examples that made studying less stressful. I even stayed back after class one day to ask him about a few tough problems. He explained each one patiently and encouraged me to practice regularly instead of worrying too much about marks.

When the results came out, I did better than I expected — and the first person I wanted to thank was Mr. Srinivasan. His teaching didn’t just help me score well, but it helped me build confidence. For the first time in my life, I started to actually enjoy solving maths problems. That feeling of improvement and self-belief is something I will always be grateful for.

Looking back at the past few months, I realize how much his guidance has shaped my learning attitude. He has shown me that a good teacher isn’t just someone who explains the syllabus — it’s someone who makes learning feel possible. I am truly thankful to Mr. Srinivasan for his kindness, his dedication, and his effort to make mathematics simple and interesting for all of us. Because of him, I now look at maths not as a fear, but as a challenge I can handle.



Scenario: Gratitude for My Foundation of Indian Heritage Teacher

When I joined college, I expected most of the subjects to be technical or theory-based. So, when I saw “Foundation of Indian Heritage” on the timetable, I honestly didn’t think much about it. I assumed it would be another subject with long notes and memorizing dates or cultural facts. But that impression changed completely after the very first class with our Indian Heritage teacher

From the moment he started teaching, I realized he had a very unique way of explaining things. He didn’t just teach history or culture — he told stories. The way he spoke made every topic feel alive, as if we were traveling back in time. When he talked about ancient civilizations, kings, scientists, or traditions, it didn’t sound like a textbook; it felt like a real journey through India’s past. I remember one class in October 2025, when he explained the story of the Nalanda University. He didn’t just list facts — he described how students used to walk miles to learn there, how the libraries were filled with palm-leaf manuscripts, and how knowledge was treated as sacred. His storytelling made me feel proud of India’s history and curious to know more.

What stands out most about Mr. Anand is his passion for teaching. You can see it in the way his eyes light up when he talks about Indian philosophy, art, or traditions. He connects each topic with modern life, showing us how the values from our heritage still matter today. For example, when he explained about the “Guru-Shishya” tradition, he related it to the bond between students and teachers even in today’s classrooms. That’s when I realized learning about culture isn’t just about the past — it’s about understanding where we come from and how it shapes us.

Another thing I deeply appreciate is his storytelling style. No matter how complex the topic is, he simplifies it by turning it into a conversation. He asks questions, gives examples, and even adds humor in between, so the whole class stays attentive. I’ve noticed that even students who usually get bored in theory subjects listen quietly when he speaks. His voice has that calm energy that draws everyone in. I’ve started looking forward to his classes because they don’t feel like lectures — they feel like listening to a wise storyteller.

One day after class, I told him how much I liked his way of teaching. He smiled and said, “When knowledge is shared as a story, it stays in the heart, not just in the notebook.” That line stayed with me. It made me understand why I remember every detail from his lessons — it’s because he makes me feel connected to what I’m learning.

I feel a deep sense of gratitude towards Mr. Anand for changing my perspective about learning. Before his classes, I used to think heritage was something old and outdated.






scenario:family
October 2025, I had started adjusting to college life. But deep down, I missed home more than I admitted. Being away from family for the first time made me realize how much they did for me every single day. From waking me up in the morning to making sure I never missed breakfast — all those things I took for granted suddenly became memories I missed the most.

One weekend, I called home after a particularly tiring week. I had messed up a lab assignment and was feeling completely drained. When my mom picked up the call, I couldn’t hold it in and ended up venting everything — how hard college felt, how I missed home, and how I wasn’t sure if I was doing enough. She didn’t interrupt me. She just listened. After a pause, she said, “You’re learning, and that’s all that matters. Don’t be too hard on yourself.”

Those simple words gave me strength I didn’t know I had lost. Later that week, my dad texted me saying how proud he was of me for managing things on my own. It made me emotional because I realized how much faith my parents had in me — even when I doubted myself.

I’m deeply grateful to my parents, not just for sending me to college but for their unconditional love and emotional support. Every message, every call, every “take care” from them reminds me that I’m not alone. Whenever I feel like giving up, I remember that they’re the reason I’m here — working towards something bigger.

These five months in college have taught me that gratitude isn’t just about saying “thank you.” It’s about recognizing the people who silently stand by you, believe in you, and shape you without even realizing it. My family, my mentor, and my first friend have all played a huge role in helping me grow — and for that, I’ll always be thankful.
