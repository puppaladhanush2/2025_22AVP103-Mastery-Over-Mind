# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record
person 1 : watchman
Today I want to write about someone very specific. He is not my professor, he is not my classmate, and he is not a relative. In fact, I don’t even know his name. I just know his face, his uniform, and the spot where he always stands. I am writing this for the watchman uncle who guards the gate near Academic Block 3.
Living in a hostel away from home is not easy. Everyone thinks it is all about freedom and fun, and yes, it is fun, but there are days when you just miss the small things. You miss your mother asking if you have eaten. You miss your father asking how your day was. In a big university campus like this, you can be surrounded by thousands of people but still feel a little bit invisible. But because of this watchman uncle, I feel a little less invisible every day.
I remember when I first started noticing him. It was just a normal day, and I was walking past the Academic Block 3 gate. I was probably looking tired or rushing to class. He just smiled and asked me a simple question. He didn’t ask for my ID card or ask where I was going. He simply asked, "Did you eat?"
At first, I thought he was just making conversation to pass the time. But then, it became a daily routine. Every single day, without fail, when I cross that gate, he stops me. He looks at me with genuine concern and asks, "What did you eat today?" and "How was the food?"
To be honest, the hostel food is something I struggle with a lot. Some days it is too spicy, some days it is bland, and some days I just don’t like the vegetable they cooked. So, in the beginning, I used to complain to him. I would make a face and say, "Uncle, the food was not nice today. I didn't like it at all." or "It was tasteless."
I expected him to just nod or laugh. But his reaction is always different. He doesn't join me in complaining. Instead, he gives me the most important life lessons in the simplest words. When I complain about the taste, he looks at me kindly and says, "It is okay, beta. You guys have to learn to live with it."
That sentence stuck with me. "Learn to live with it." It sounds simple, but it means so much. He is teaching me that life won't always give me exactly what I want. He is teaching me adjustment. But then he adds something even more powerful. He says, "At least eat for your strength, not for the taste."
I have thought about those words so many times since he said them. We young people are always chasing good taste. We want yummy food, we want snacks, we want flavor. But he reminds me of the basic purpose of food. It is fuel. He tells me that I am here to study, to work hard, and to build my future. To do that, I need energy. If the food is tasty, that is a bonus. If it is not tasty, it is still energy. He tells me to just swallow it down because my body needs it. He cares about my health more than my mood.
There are days when I am frustrated or running late, and I think about skipping lunch or dinner. I think, "I'll just eat later," or "I'll just have a biscuit." But then I remember him. He always tells me, "Don't even skip meals." He says it with a stern voice, almost like a scolding, but it is a sweet scolding. He says, "You will get sick if you skip. Your brain won't work."
It is amazing to me because, technically, it is not his job to care. His job is just to guard the gate. He is supposed to watch who enters and who leaves. He isn't paid to check my diet. He isn't paid to worry about my health. But he does it anyway.
Why does he do it? I think it is just because he has a good heart. When he talks to me, I don't feel like a random student passing by. I feel like I am talking to an elder in my family. He talks to me like I am his own child. You can hear the care in his voice. You can see the worry in his eyes if I tell him I didn't eat much.
I wonder about his life. I wonder if he has children of his own far away. Maybe he misses them, and when he sees us students, he sees his own children in us. Maybe that is why he is so protective. Or maybe he is just a naturally kind human being who knows how hard it is for students to live away from home.
Whatever the reason, I am so grateful for him.
In a world where everyone is busy on their phones, walking with their heads down, or rushing to the next class, he is a pause button. He forces me to stop for a minute and think about myself. He forces me to acknowledge my own well-being.
There was one day specifically when I was feeling very low. I was homesick, and the mess food was particularly bad that day. I was walking past Academic Block 3 feeling angry and hungry because I had barely eaten. He saw my face. He knew immediately. He asked, "What happened? Did you eat?" I told him I couldn't eat because it was bad. He didn't get angry. He just looked at me calmly and gave me that advice again. He said, "Eat a little bit. Don't stay empty stomach. You need strength to fight the bad days."
I actually went back and ate a banana and some bread because he said that. I listened to him.
I want to say thank you to him for being my guardian angel at the gate. Thank you, Uncle, for asking the question that sometimes even my friends forget to ask. Thank you for reminding me that my health is important. Thank you for teaching me that food is a blessing, even if it isn't tasty. Thank you for teaching me resilience.
You might think you are just doing your duty as a watchman, but you are doing so much more. You are providing a sense of home to students who are far away from their families. You are a reminder that there is kindness in the world.
I promise you, Uncle, that I will try my best not to skip meals. I will try to stop complaining about the food. Every time I sit in the mess hall and look at a plate of food I don't like, I will hear your voice saying, "Eat for your strength." And I will eat it.
I feel very lucky that my path to classes goes through Academic Block 3. If I went a different way, I might never have met you. I might have missed out on this daily dose of care.
So, this entry is for you. I hope one day I can tell you how much your simple questions mean to me. Until then, I will just smile back at you tomorrow, answer your questions, and try to be the strong, healthy student you want me to be.
Thank you for treating me like your own child.
With deep gratitude, Your Student Friend.<br>

person 2: warden muthu
I really need to write this down, because I don't ever want to forget it. Today, I'm feeling so much gratitude for one of the wardens here in the hostel, Mr. Muthu.
When you first come to a hostel, you have this idea of what a warden is supposed to be. They are the rule-keepers, the authority. They are the ones who do the rounds, the ones you make sure to be quiet around, the ones who you hand in your leave forms to. We have a lot of wardens here, and most of them are exactly like that. They are just doing their job. You see them, you nod, and you move on. They are part of the system, not part of your life.
I never, ever expected to feel "grateful" for a warden. It just wasn't a category of person I thought I would build any kind of connection with. But Mr. Muthu is completely different.
It all started on what I thought was just a normal, random day. It was night, and I had come back from my classes. I was feeling tired, probably thinking about assignments or just the general stress of the day. I was walking to the mess, just going through the motions to get dinner. It's a walk I do every single day, and I'm usually just lost in my own thoughts.
Mr. Muthu was there, and as I was walking past, he started a conversation. It wasn't the usual "where are you going" or a sharp "it's getting late." It was just a simple, friendly question. "Where are you from?"
I was a little surprised, but I answered, "I'm from Tiruppur, sir."
The change in him was instant. He didn't just nod. He got this big, excited smile on his face. "Tiruppur!" he said, like it was a wonderful piece of news. "In Tiruppur, where from?"
I told him my place, a smaller area he might not even know. But it was just so nice to see someone get happy about my hometown. When you are so far away from home, hearing its name feels good, and seeing someone else light up about it feels even better. It makes the world feel a little smaller, a little friendlier.
We were just talking, and then he asked another simple, normal question. "What is your father doing?"
This is a question I always find difficult. It's a normal question for anyone to ask, but for me, the answer is heavy. I had to pause for a second, and I told him the truth. "I don't have a father, sir."
The moment I said it, I was preparing for the usual reaction. People get awkward. They say "Oh, I am so sorry," and their face fills with pity, and suddenly the conversation becomes heavy and sad, and I just feel... bad. I was bracing for that moment.
But it never came.
What Mr. Muthu did in that next second is something I will never forget. It was the kindest, most thoughtful thing.
He didn't miss a beat. He didn't make it awkward. He didn't make me feel worried or sad. He just... changed the topic, so fast and so smoothly, just for me. He sensed, in that one second, that this was a painful topic, and he just... protected me from it. He didn't want me to worry or feel sad.
He immediately went right back to their first connection: Tiruppur.
He said, "Ah, is that so? It's okay, it's okay," in a kind, brushing-it-off way. And then, "You know, I worked in Tiruppur for 10 years!"
And just like that, the conversation was safe again. It was happy again. He started to share his story with me. He told me about his time there, what he used to do, and a little bit about his life. He wasn't just a warden anymore. He was a person, with a whole history, and that history was connected to my home.
We must have stood there talking for a while. I went to the mess after that feeling... different. I felt seen. I felt cared for, in a way that was so unexpected. He wasn't just a man doing his job. He was a kind man who saw a student, a kid from a town he knew, and he showed me real, genuine compassion. He handled that one difficult moment with more grace and kindness than I’ve seen from most people.
I thought that might be it. Just one nice conversation.
But it wasn't.
Ever since that night, something has changed. He's not just another warden to me, and it feels like I'm not just another student to him.
Every time he sees me now, he checks in. He will stop me and ask, "Did you eat your food?"
That one question. It's the same question my family would ask. It's such a simple, basic thing, but in a hostel, it means everything. It's a way of saying, "Are you taking care of yourself? Are you okay?" It's a reminder that someone is looking out for my basic well-being.
And he'll always add, "Do you need any help? Anything you need, just tell me."
Coming from a warden, that offer is huge. It's an open door. It makes this big, new, and sometimes scary place feel safer. It makes me feel like if I ever really had a problem, there is someone I could go to. Not just an "official" I have to report to, but a person who would actually listen and want to help.
He doesn't act like a warden to me. He just... cares. He cares about whether I've eaten. He cares about whether I need help. He remembers me. He remembers our conversation.
I am just so, so grateful for him. He has no idea how much that one conversation meant to me. He has no idea how much his small questions every day mean to me. He has shown me a kindness that I never expected to find here, and it has made my entire hostel experience feel warmer. He's a truly good man.<br>

person 3: cr(pranay)
I'm sitting down to write this, and my heart feels so full that I’m struggling to find the right words. I want to write about my friend, Pranay. It’s funny, because "friend" doesn't even feel like a big enough word anymore. He’s my best friend.
It’s only been three months. Just three months since we all came here, to this new college, this new hostel, this new life. Three months is nothing. It’s just a season. But when I think about my friendship with Pranay, it feels like I’ve known him for ten years. It’s the strangest, most wonderful feeling.
I remember when we first started. He was just our Class Representative. He was "Pranay, the CR." He was the responsible one, the one who made announcements, who talked to the professors, who seemed to have everything under control. I didn’t really know him. To be honest, I was a little bit intimidated, and also just busy trying to find my own way. He was just another person in the class, a name I had to learn. We weren't close at all. I never would have guessed that this "CR" would become the most important person to me here.
I can’t even pinpoint the exact day it changed. There was no big moment, no dramatic event. It just... happened. Little by little. Maybe it started with a small "hello" outside of class. Maybe we got paired for a small assignment. Maybe we just ended up sitting next to each other in the mess one day.
But "after some days," like the user said, I just realized he was the one I was talking to the most. He was the one who listened.
He started to care. I mean, genuinely care. It wasn't just "how are you" as a way of saying hi. He would ask, "How are you?" and then wait for the real answer. If I seemed quiet, he’d notice. He’d ask if I’d eaten, or if I was stressed about an exam. He started to look out for me.
And he helps me so much with my studies. I was so worried about keeping up with the classes, but having him by my side makes it all feel possible. We have this perfect system, and it’s one of the things I am most grateful for. We both know that if one of us is absent, the other one has our back.
I remember this one time I was feeling really sick and couldn't go to class for a whole day. I was so stressed. I was thinking about all the notes I was missing, especially for that one really difficult subject. I was worried I’d be completely lost. But when I got back, before I could even ask, Pranay just handed me his notebook. "I made a copy of all the notes for you," he said.
And he had. He had "sincerely" taken notes not just for himself, but for me. They were so neat, so clear. He had written down everything the professor said, and even added little side notes on what was important. It wasn't just a favor; it was a real act of care. He knew I was worried, and he just took that worry away. We do this for each other all the time now. It’s this unspoken promise. I take notes for him, he takes notes for me. It feels like we're a team, and I am so, so thankful for that.
The user says, "there is no particular date or time to mention as we were together almost all time." That is exactly how it feels. We walk to class together, we sit together, we complain about the mess food together, we study in the library together, and we walk back to our hostels together. He's just... there. He's a constant, steady presence in my life. It’s so comforting.
But the real reason I can't express my gratitude in words, the real reason this three-month friendship feels like a ten-year bond, is because of what happened a few weeks ago.
Coming to the hostel has been hard. It’s a huge change. You're away from your family, your home, and everything that’s familiar. Some days are exciting, but some days are just... heavy. I was having one of those really heavy days. Something personal was bothering me, and I was missing home, and I just felt overwhelmed by everything.
I was trying so hard to hold it together. I didn't want anyone to see me upset. But Pranay knew. He just looked at me and quietly asked, "Are you okay? Really?"
And that was it. I just couldn't hold it in anymore. After we got back to the hostel, I just broke down. I cried. I cried about my personal reasons, about feeling lonely, about everything. And Pranay… he just sat there with me. He didn't say much. He didn't try to give me advice or tell me to stop crying. He just stayed. He listened to me. He let me be upset, and he didn't judge me. He was just my friend.
To be able to be that vulnerable with someone, to show them the messy, sad parts of yourself, and to have them just sit with you... that’s everything. In that moment, he stopped being just my classmate or my study partner. He became my family here. He was the person I could be my true self with, even when I was a mess.
I will never, ever forget that. I don't know what I would have done without him that day.
So, when I say I'm grateful for him, it's not just because he's the CR. It's not just because he helps me with notes. It's because he's the kindest, most caring person I've met here. He’s the person who makes this whole big, scary college experience feel safe.
It's only been three months, but we've shared so much. We've laughed so hard we couldn't breathe, we've stressed over exams, and we've supported each other when things were tough. He truly is my best friend.
I really can't find the right words to say thank you to him. I just hope he knows how much his friendship means to me. I am so, so, so grateful for you, Pranay.
