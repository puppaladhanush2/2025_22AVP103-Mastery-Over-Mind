## Journal Record

(Srinivasan sir)Today I just wanna say how thankful I am for my Maths Sir. He’s honestly the most patient teacher ever. No matter how many times I ask him to explain the same thing, he never gets annoyed — he just smiles and explains it again until I get it.He always gives real-life examples that make maths make sense. Like, when we were learning algebra, he used examples about computer picturing. In geometry, he talked about buildings and shapes we see every day. That actually helps me understand better instead of just memorizing formulas.He’s also the kind of teacher who helps with everything — not just maths problems but also if we’re stressed or confused about collage stuff. He always says mistakes are okay and part of learning, which really motivates me.because of him, I’ve started liking maths a lot more. I’m honestly lucky to have a teacher who’s so kind, helpful, and always ready to make sure everyone understands.

Today I just wanna say thanks to my friend who always keeps me on track.he's the one who tells me to wake up early, study, and stop wasting time whenever I start getting lazy.Somehow, he always know when I’m losing focus and give me that little push I need.He helped me in so many ways — not just with studies, but also when I was low on money or feeling down.He never make a big deal about it; He just quietly help and move on.I really like how he's always there to listen and make me laugh when things get stressful.Honestly, life feels a lot easier with them around.I may not say it much, but I’m super grateful to have a friend like that who always has my back no matter what.

(yuthesh) I just wanna talk about my friend who’s basically a legend at sports. He’s crazy good at cricket and pretty much every game he touches. The cool thing is, he never shows off — instead, he actually teaches me and helps me get better.When I first tried cricket, I was honestly terrible, but he still took time to teach me how to hold the bat, swing right, and not look like a total noob. He’s always pushing me to join matches or school events, even when I don’t feel confident. Somehow he just knows how to hype me up and make me believe I can actually do it.And when I’ve been in trouble, he’s that guy who steps in and helps me out without even thinking twice. He’s just a solid dude — fun to be around, easy to talk to, and always got my back.Life’s honestly way better with him around. If there was a trophy for best bro, he’d totally win it every time.
