I'm grateful to my friends Sathwika and Deepthi in Amrita University for their polite behaviour and helping nature . They did not make me feel homesick during starting days of my college . It's my first time being in hostel since childhood but my friends made my day to day works a bit easy because they help me in completing my works in academics and we together clean our room without any hesitation . A fun part about sharing room with them is they wakes up first because of my alarm and then they wakes me up. We share our food with eachother and we go to a walk during evenings which refreshes us. So i wish to show my gratitude towards my friends.
