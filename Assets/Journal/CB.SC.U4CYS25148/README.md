## Journal Record
SCENARIO-1 A GOKULASTHAMI NIGHT TO REMEMBER
I am typing this to show my gratitude towards a senior friend from CSE during the gokulashtami.His name was SanjayAfter the celebration of gokulashtami At night
I forget about the route towards my hostel. He was the one who helped me to guide towards the hostel.Also he shared about his experience from the collage and details 
about placement , a study routine. Which makes me to come up with a mind to how do I want to schedule my routine.
He was going to be placed in January . I felt my thanks to him and wishing him to be placed in the high earning job.

SCENARIO-2 A UNSUNG HEROES
I am typing this to show my gratitude towards the canteen staff during the mid sem period . I was just in a hurry for my maths exam to take my lunch I just visited
the sopanam canteen there was too much of a crowd. In that crowd also they serve each customer in a good manner . My order just got within 5 min I enjoyed my lunch
and wrote my maths exam very well .

SCENARIO-3 FIH LEGEND
I am typing this to show my gratitude towards Karthik sir before the mid term . He doesn't just teach, he tells stories. He can take any topic and make it so 
engaging that the whole class is just locked in.The thing that I love the most is how interactive he makes it. I remember the lesson he gave on Dharma.
I am not exaggerating when I say that it gave me goosebumps. And then, of course, there are lessons that are frankly boring but while He was talking about the British rule in India  that how the British brainwashed Indians so that they are the persons who develop the technology in India. Hearing that made me so angry.So his teaching not only made us learn about history also brings up the emotion that our ancestors were suffered.I'm just really thankful to have him as a teacher.
