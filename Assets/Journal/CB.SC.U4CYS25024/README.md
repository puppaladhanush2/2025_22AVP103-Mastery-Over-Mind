</p>The three incidents that happened which i really grateful am for are..

Near start of august..
At the beginning of our college days like some of my friends I too was nervous about college. New environment , new faces and all that stuff obviously did not help. The first 2 days went kind of okayish thanks very much to my friends. But it also kind of made me wonder
how these 4 years would go by especaially on our first day on bus. But fortunately thats where I met Saubarnika. She was studying ECE in our college which was the course I had wanted to do. She was kind to tell me everything about college and other things . Since she also studied in the same school as me (which I toatally didnt expect) we became really close. I think she was the first ever friend I got in college here. From then on we sat next to each other. She has a really nice and positive attitude towards everything in life which was really admirable. It was only after meeting her that I kindof became convinced that I would meet my people here..
But also I'd like to tell that she and I are no longer sitting next to eachother due to not enough seatings being available..But still thanks to that one senior who kindof helped me really well.

Near mid august..
The teacher who kindof inspired me a lot was our Principles of Engineering proffessor Amit Agarwal. What made me to be inspired by him was his way of teaching. His way of teaching was really carefree which forced us to search for the syllabus ourselves which proved really grateful as it made us understand the concepts ourselves. I think in my opinion that it is the best way to learn things because that way the things we learn would be way more interesting..

At the starting of august..
Finally..
Of course just like everybody else the people who i found maybe fortunately but luckily .
Who dearly are Ridhanya,Tejashree,Kavya,Shivani,Anushree. They were really supportive and gave me confidence when i needed it. I really am grateful for them because without them I clearly have no idea I would have survived the first week of college so nice..
Also I really feel appreciated for this great oppurtunity i got to share what I found inspiring and grateful..really thanking you sir..
