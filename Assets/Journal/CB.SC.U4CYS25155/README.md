# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1
Date: August 10
Whom: Amit Agarwal Sir
Today, I would like to thank one of the greatest motivating teachers I have ever had, Professor Amit Agarwal Sir. Whenever I think of those who made a real difference in my journey of academics and personal growth, his name comes first. From the very first day I attended his class, I sensed something different about the way he approached teaching. It wasn’t just about finishing the syllabus or making us memorize formulas and definitions — it was about making us understand, question, and connect what we were learning to the real world.The one thing that amazes me most about Amit Agarwal Sir is his patience. He never makes students feel small for not knowing something. No matter how many times someone asks the same question, he listens carefully, explains it again with a smile, and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on. This quality itself has brought a great change in the way I approach learning. In many classes, students often don't raise their hands because they fear being judged or scolded. But in his class, that fear disappears. 

He builds a space where curiosity is celebrated and mistakes are seen as a part of learning.There are several moments that really proved him to be a special teacher. I recall this one time when I was stuck with a complex concept and thought that it was just too hard to comprehend. I'd read the book, done videos online, but whatever I tried, absolutely nothing made sense. During one of his lectures, I asked him about it, expecting just a brief answer. Instead, he paused the lesson for a moment, went to the board, and explained the whole concept in a completely new way — using simple examples and everyday analogies. Suddenly, everything clicked. I can still recall that feeling of clarity and relief when I finally understood. From that day on, I knew that this was it: great teachers don't just deliver information; they transform how you think and learn.Another thing that I really admire about Sir is his love for the subject. You can see the spark in his eyes when he teaches. It's contagious; it makes students excited about learning, even about things that may initially appear to be boring. He often relates lessons in the classroom to real-life applications, making the content come alive. Every time he shares stories about the discovery, experiments, or people behind certain scientific ideas, it reminds me that learning is not just about passing exams, but it's about understanding the world and finding inspiration in knowledge.What sets Amit Agarwal Sir apart is not just his brilliance as a teacher but also his humanity towards the students.

I have seen him encouraging certain students who were shy or struggling by instilling confidence in them to speak up or try again. His words are always so thoughtful and reach a motivational chord. He often tells us that everyone learns at their own pace and that effort counts more than immediate success. This message stayed with me through tough times. Whenever I face difficulties, I remind myself of his advice: “Never stop being curious, and never give up just because something seems hard.”His influence extends far beyond the classroom: he has taught me valuable lessons on patience, humility, and dedication. It really is a sight to see him put such care into preparing lessons, stay behind after every class to help students, and remain so enthusiastic year in and year out. It shows how much he cares about what he does and how deeply he believes in the power of education. In a world where many people rush through their work, seeing someone who gives so much of himself to teaching is rare and beautiful. also appreciate how approachable he is. Many professors seem distant or unapproachable, but Sir is always there when we need guidance. Whether it’s academic advice or personal encouragement, he listens with genuine interest. There was one time when I felt overpowered with assignments piling up and began to doubt my abilities. The moment he noticed that I wasn’t participating as much in class, quietly after the lecture, he called out to me. He didn’t scold or question me but instead asked if everything was okay. We talked for a while, and his words helped me regain my focus and confidence. That small gesture meant a lot to me. It reminded me that great teachers don’t just teach subjects; they nurture people.Over time, I have come to realize that what I learned most from Amit Agarwal Sir is not about academics; rather, it is a particular way of approaching learning and life. He says many times that the day you take off the pressure of grades and enjoy the process of discovery, that is actually when real learning starts. That perspective changed how I think about my studies. Now, even if I struggle with a topic, instead of frustration, I at least try to stay curious. I have learned to ask questions, explore multiple viewpoints, and see failure as an opportunity for improvement.Sir's influence has also made me a better person outside of academics. His humility despite his expertise reminds me that knowledge and kindness must go hand in hand. He once shared with us that he still considers himself a student, always learning from his experiences and from others. That statement really moved me. It showed me that no matter how much you achieve, there’s always room to grow.

I can now look back at my journey and find how much he shaped my attitude and confidence. His encouragement made me take part in class discussions, execute projects that earlier seemed to be difficult, and trust my abilities. His belief in his students has a powerful effect-it makes us want to prove ourselves worthy of that kind of trust. If I had to describe Amit Agarwal Sir in a few words, I'd say he's not just a teacher; he's a mentor, a guide, an inspiration. His classroom is more than a place to study; it's a space where ideas grow, where learning feels meaningful, and where every student feels valued. Every time I walk out of his class, I feel a little more confident, a little more curious, and a lot more motivated to do my best. It’s easy to let appreciation slide by in today’s fast-paced world. Writing down this entry of my gratitude journal made me feel grateful for every moment when I have a teacher like Amit Agarwal Sir. His passion for teaching and patience with all his students and an interest in lifelong learning continue to inspire me day after day. One day, when I will look at my college years, I will remember not just the grades earned but the values and lessons learned from him — lessons about perseverance, curiosity, and kindness. Thank you, Sir, for everything: for your time, your wisdom, and your unfailing support. You have not only taught me academics but helped me grow as a person. I'll always be grateful for your guidance, and I'll carry your lessons with me wherever life takes me.


Scenario 2
Date: August 21
Whom: Rohith
 Today, I want to express my gratitude to one of the most important people in my college life-my dear friend, Rohith. Whenever I think about all those people who have truly made a difference in my journey, his is the first name that comes to my mind. I consider myself very fortunate to have him in my life. Friendship has always been one of the most powerful support systems in my life, and Rohith has proved time and again what true friendship really means.There was an easy sense of connection from the very first day. It didn’t take long for us to transition from just classmates to becoming close friends who could talk about anything: studies, life, dreams, and even silly things that made no sense but made us laugh endlessly. Over time, he became more like family than a friend. As I look back on my college journey so far, so many of my happiest and most memorable moments have Rohith in them.His consistency is one of the things I admire most in him. However busy or stressed he might be, whenever I need somebody to talk to, he's always there. There have been days when everything felt too heavy — assignments piling up, exam pressure, and moments of self-doubt. Somehow, Rohith always noticed when something was wrong, even if I didn't say anything. He would either crack a joke to make me smile or sit quietly until I felt better. Many times, he doesn't have to say much; just his presence brought comfort. That's what makes him special; he doesn't just hear you, he understands you.

My late-night study sessions with them remain etched in my memory. How many nights did we sit together, surrounded by innumerable textbooks, empty coffee cups, and an endless heap of notes, trying to make some sense out of complex topics? What could have been stressful nights were playful and memorable because of him. He always found a way to make even serious study sessions light-hearted. If one of us got frustrated or tired, the other would cheer them up with a funny story, a sarcastic comment, or sometimes just snacks. Those little things made the greatest difference.I also admire Rohith's approach towards life: he has this calm, poised manner of handling things. Even when things are really tough, he doesn't get rattled or grumble. He thinks over things and then focuses on finding a solution. And through him, I learned much about how to handle challenges with maturity. Often, he keeps telling me that instead of bothering about a problem, trying to solve it is the way to go. The simplest kind of mindset, yet it has helped in changing my life, not only in college but everywhere.
Rohith is not only supportive in difficult times, but he is the first among them to share happiness in the successes of others. Anytime anything good happens with me, or even some small achievement, he is genuinely happy and proud. That sincerity is not shared by too many. He has taught me that true friendship is growing together, not competition. I will always find him there for honest advice rather than telling me what I would like to hear. At the selection of the topic of a project, studying for an exam, or any decision related to my personal life, his opinion helps me see things clearer.
College life, while exciting, is filled with ups and downs. There will be days when motivation is low, day plans don't go as well as intended, or loneliness kicks in amidst being around people. In such times, Rohith has been my anchor. He has seen the best and worst of me, and yet he never judged me. He instead encouraged me to keep going, get focused on the positives, and believe in myself. Emotional support of that kind is something I will always hold dear.
There was a point in one particularly stressful semester when I just wanted to call it quits. The workload was too heavy, and I was burnt out. Rohith noticed my frustration and would not allow me to shut him out. He sat with me, organized my schedule, and even studied with me for hours, just to make sure that I would not fall behind. At that moment, I realized how selfless and kind he truly is. He didn't have to help, yet he did, without expecting anything in return. That's the kind of friend everyone hopes to have but very few actually find.

I think another thing that is really special about our friendship is how much we can be ourselves around each other. There's no need to pretend or act a certain way. We share our insecurities, talk about our dreams, and laugh at the most random things without being scared of being misunderstood. He's one of those rare people with whom it's comfortable to be in silence-even when we're not talking, it feels peaceful. That sense of ease is something I value deeply.
I also love how Rohith has this ability to bring people together. He's always the one who plans group outings, keeps everyone laughing, and makes sure no one feels left out. His energy is contagious; when he's around, the whole mood changes. He's the kind of person who can turn an ordinary day into something unforgettable. Whether it's a random coffee break, a spontaneous walk after class, or a late-night conversation under the stars, he finds joy in the simplest moments and helps others do the same.What I find truly inspiring about him is a mixture of humor and wisdom. He can make you laugh until your stomach hurts one minute, and the next, he gives the most reflective advice. It's a rare balance-being both fun and deeply understanding. He doesn't ever claim to have the answers, but somehow, his words always just make sense.

He has taught me that it is okay not to have everything worked out just so long as we keep trying and look after each other.
As I write this, it occurs to me how much Rohith has influenced who I am today. His positivity, patience, and kindness have rubbed off on me. I've become more empathetic, more grounded, and more grateful because of his friendship. He has shown me that real friends are not just there for the happy moments but also during the storms — when things are uncertain and messy. Life at college without him would just not be complete. Most of the time, my memories have him in them-laughs, night talks, fights over studying before exams, and inside jokes only he and I understand. These may seem like tiny things, but they make up the essence of friendship-shared experiences that turn into stories we will tell and laugh at for years to come. Rohith has taught me that friendship is not about how long you have known a person, but how deeply they care and how genuinely they stand by you. He has shown me the importance of loyalty, trust, and emotional connection. I know that even after college when we move into different walks of life, this bond will only remain strong. True friendships don't fade away with distance or time; they become part of who you are. So let me just say, thank you today, Rohith. Thanks for being there through thick and thin, for believing in me when I didn't believe in myself, for all the laughter, advice, and quiet support. You've made my college life brighter, happier, and so much more meaningful. I hope I've been even half as good a friend to you as you've been to me. With every further step in my journey, I take along the lessons and memories we have shared. Your friendship taught me what kindness and companionship really feel like; for this, I am eternally grateful. College just wouldn't have been the same without you — and neither would life for that matter.

Scenario 3
date: August 28
Whom: Praveen sir
Today I want to take a minute to express my deep gratitude to Praveen Sir-a man who may never be in the spotlight but whose presence makes all the difference in the daily life of our college. There are people who leave an impression not through grand gestures or titles but through their quiet consistency, genuine kindness, and ever-present smile. For me, Praveen Sir is that kind of person. His positive energy and helpful nature have turned our college from just a place of learning into a friendly and humane one.Every day, upon entering the college premises, I often see him greeting students and faculty with a hearty "Good morning." Sure, it might sound like a small thing, but on days when I'm tired, stressed, or just not in the mood to face a long day of classes, that simple greeting always manages to lift my spirits. There's something about his warmth that reminds everyone that life still holds a lot of kindness in store.What I have always noticed about Praveen Sir is that he is never too busy to help someone out. Be it a student looking for some classroom, a staff member with a lot of papers, or somebody who needs help with college equipment or some papers - he is just there, ready to help. And all this, he does with such patience and humor that it is infectious. A sneak peek at his work has made me realize how small acts of service, if done genuinely, can be so powerful.

There was this one particular incident that revealed his generosity and helping nature. It was during a very busy week when our department had continuous events and internal exams. Everybody was running around, trying to get things done. I remember I was in charge of setting up some equipment for a presentation, but nothing was working. I must have looked completely lost because Praveen Sir noticed from across the hall and came over. Within minutes, he calmly figured out the problem and helped fix it. But what stood out wasn’t just the fact that he solved the issue — it was the manner in which he did it. He didn’t make me feel embarrassed or inexperienced at all. Instead, he reassured me with a smile, saying, “It happens to everyone — don’t worry, you did well trying to handle it yourself.” That simple act of kindness lightened up what had been a very stressful morning.Such moments may appear very ordinary; however, they speak volumes about his character. He respects everyone be it a senior professor, a fresh student, or a backstage worker. His humility and approachability make him someone everyone trusts. Many among us students have come to seek his assistance over small yet significant matters finding classrooms during changes of timetables, reporting maintenance issues, or setting things up for practical sessions. He never shows irritation or impatience even if the same questions are asked many times. Instead, he listens carefully and ensures that the problem is resolved.

 What really inspires me is that he does all his duties with such great joy. One can see the pride in his work, whatever be the magnitude of the work. In a world where people often overlook everyday acts of kindness, Praveen Sir does remind us that being helpful and positive is also a form of leadership. He may not teach a subject from a textbook, but he teaches us something similarly important: how to be kind, patient, and respectful to everyone.But there's something profoundly admirable about his consistency too: day in, day out, whatever the weather or size of his workload, he's there with the same cheery attitude. It may be easy to be kind sometimes, but it really takes an act of real character to keep that attitude going every single day. His constancy has made me reflect on how even the smallest gestures-like smiling, greeting, or helping hand-can have a ripple effect. Because of him, I've noticed more students smiling at each other in the hallways, more saying "thank you," and more appreciation for those who do the behind-the-scenes work that keeps the college running smoothly.
 Praveen Sir has this way of making the college environment feel more human and less mechanical. Sometimes, college life might be overwhelming, full of deadlines, examinations, and expectations. But then, you see someone like him taking the time to talk to students, remembering names, or asking how your day is going; it creates a sense of community. This reminds us that college is not just about academics but the people who make it a place worth being in.

I remember a rainy morning when most of us were running to class, trying to keep dry. The corridors were slushy, and the puddles made some of the students struggle with umbrellas and bags. I saw Praveen Sir with a mop, cleaning up the puddles and cautioning everybody to be careful. It wasn't his duty to do that, but he did it without any qualms. When somebody thanked him, all he said was, "If we all do a little, it becomes easy for everyone." That sentence has stayed with me. It's such a simple truth-helping each other makes life easier and better for all.Sometimes, I think about how unnoticed people like him often are. They work tirelessly in the background, ensuring that everything runs smoothly, yet they rarely get any kind of formal recognition. But their influence is profound. Without their support, college wouldn't run as effectively or feel as friendly as it does. Praveen Sir's presence has taught me to appreciate everyone's contribution, not just those in visible positions, but also those who quietly make a difference every single day.

He is also a very good example of positivity. Whenever things go wrong-sudden schedule changes, technical glitches, last-minute event arrangements-he does not lose his composure. He laughs, says, "We'll manage," and somehow, things always get done. Seeing him handle chaos with so much calmness taught me how to handle stress better. He's taught me that attitude matters more than circumstances. What I find most inspiring about Praveen Sir is the way he believes in kindness as a way of life. He once told some frustrated students, “Being kind costs nothing, but it gives everything.” That line might sound simple, but it’s deeply true. Through his everyday actions, he reminds us that kindness is not just a word — it’s a choice, made repeatedly in small ways that brighten someone else’s day. When I think about my college memories years from now, I know I'll remember people like Praveen Sir. Not because of grand speeches or big events, but because of the warmth he brought into ordinary days. His smile in the hallway, his helpfulness during stressful moments, and his respectful attitude toward everyone have all left a lasting impression on me. In many ways, he embodies the spirit of what a good institution should be: not just a place of education, but a community built upon empathy and cooperation. He shows us once more that we can all make a difference regardless of our role. I’ve learned from him that you don’t need authority or titles to influence people — you just need kindness, sincerity, and a willingness to help. So, today I want to genuinely thank Praveen Sir for all that he does-for the smiles, the small acts of service, and the constant positivity he brings to our campus. He probably doesn't realize it, but his kindness creates a ripple that goes way beyond what he sees. People like him make the world-and our college-a better place to be in. I hope I can take forward a bit of his kindness in my life and spread it at every place I go.
