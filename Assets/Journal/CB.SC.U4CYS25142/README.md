# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
Scenario 1
date-august 07
whom: sree sai(Friend) 
When I first started college, everything felt new and unfamiliar. I was excited, but I was also nervous and a little scared. It was my first time away from home for so long. As someone who gets homesick easily, those first few days were tough. Everything, from the classrooms to the hostel and the canteen, felt strange. I saw groups of students laughing and walking together, but I didn’t know anyone. I mostly kept to myself, observing things and trying to settle in. That’s when I met Sree Sai, and my experience began to change from that moment.He was from another branch, but he had joined college a few days earlier than I did. Because of that, he already knew some things about the campus. One afternoon, while I was walking around trying to find a lab, he noticed I looked lost and came to help. He showed me where things were and explained how the schedule worked. What I liked most was how friendly and genuine he was. He spoke to me like we had known each other for a long time. That small act of kindness meant a lot to me.Slowly, we started talking more often. He shared stories about his branch, his classes, and even warned me about which canteen items to avoid. It felt good to have someone to talk to finally. Within days, I realized he wasn’t just helping me find places; he was also helping me feel comfortable in this new environment. Whenever I felt out of place or confused, I knew I could ask him without feeling shy.

He understood my situation because he had also been new just a few days before me. He told me he felt awkward and homesick at first as well. Hearing that made me feel better because I realized I wasn’t alone in those feelings. Whenever we spoke, I began to feel lighter and calmer. I didn’t even notice when college started to feel less scary and more familiar.There were days when I missed my family a lot, especially during the first few weekends when most students went home and I stayed back in the hostel. Those evenings were the hardest. I would sit in my room scrolling through old photos and feeling emotional. But Sree Sai made sure I didn’t feel lonely. He would message me to see if I wanted to go for a walk or have dinner together. Sometimes we just sat near the canteen, chatting about random things—movies, music, food, or our school memories. Those simple moments helped me more than he probably realized.One thing I will always remember about him is how kind he was to everyone. He never cared which branch someone was from or how close they were; he was helpful to all. That quality really inspired me. He once told me, “When you’re new to a place, even one friendly person can change your whole mood.” That line stuck with me because it was exactly what he did for me.He also helped academically whenever he could. Even though we were in different branches, he shared tips on managing assignments and labs. During exam time, he encouraged me not to stress too much and to take breaks. I admired his calm nature. I used to overthink a lot, but after meeting him, I learned to take things easy and enjoy college life instead of worrying about every little thing.

As weeks turned into months, we became very close friends. We had our own little group where we would hang out, share food, and laugh about silly things. Looking back, I see how much I changed from the shy, homesick person I was on the first day. A big part of that change is because of Sree Sai. He helped me open up, talk to more people, and enjoy the college atmosphere instead of just getting by.Now, when I think of gratitude, his name is the first that comes to mind. To me, gratitude means appreciating those who make a real difference in your life, not through big gestures, but through small, consistent acts of kindness. That’s exactly what he did. He didn’t have to help me, but he chose to. He didn’t just show me around the campus; he made sure I was doing okay emotionally. That’s what true friendship is.Sometimes, I wonder how my first semester would have gone without him. Maybe I would have spent my time missing home and struggling to fit in. But because of him, I now have many good memories—from our evening walks to our random conversations. He helped me see college as a new beginning instead of just a challenge.Over time, I’ve started to help others the way he helped me. Whenever I see a new student looking lost or quiet, I try to talk to them or show them around. I know exactly how it feels to be new and nervous, and I want them to feel the same comfort I felt when I met Sree Sai. In a way, his kindness continues through me, and that makes me even more grateful.What I’ve learned from this experience is that friendship is one of the most valuable things in life. You never know how much one person can impact you just by being kind. People like Sree Sai remind you that genuine connections still exist. In a world where everyone seems busy with their own lives, finding someone who truly cares about your comfort is rare.

Even now, when we meet on campus, it doesn’t matter that we’re from different branches or have different schedules; we still make time to talk and share what’s happening in our lives. Whenever I face a tough day or something stressful, he’s one of the first people I reach out to. Just a few words from him can lift my mood instantly.To me, he’s more than just a friend; he’s like the first bridge that connected me to college life. He made this place feel like a second home. When I think back to my early days here, I realize how lucky I was to meet him exactly when I needed someone like that.I will always be grateful to him for being there during that time—for his help, patience, care, and friendship. He may not even realize how much his presence mattered, but to me, it meant everything. College taught me many things, but one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that people like Sree Sai make life brighter just by being themselves.So, when I say I’m grateful for him, I mean it from the heart. He made my journey easier, my days happier, and my college life more memorable. I will never forget those initial days or how he helped me through them. He turned my homesickness into happiness and showed me that sometimes, one good friend is all you need to feel at home.

SCENARIO 2
Date: from the college days
Whom:cleaning staff who clean our corridor and bathrooms
When I sit and think about the people who make our everyday college life easier, the first people that come to my mind are not the teachers or friends, but the cleaning staff who clean our corridors and bathrooms every day. They are the ones who make sure our surroundings are fresh and comfortable. Most of us don’t even notice them properly, but they quietly do their work every single day without expecting any praise. I feel really thankful and grateful for all their effort.Every morning, when I walk out of my room, I see them already at work. It’s still early, and many students are asleep, but the cleaning staff have already started sweeping the floors, washing the bathrooms, and mopping the corridors. It’s not easy work, yet they do it so patiently. Because of them, our college looks neat and feels nice to live in. If they weren’t there, we would probably have to walk in dirty corridors and use unclean bathrooms. Just thinking about that makes me realize how important they are for us.Sometimes I wonder if we really appreciate them enough. We see them daily, but how many of us actually stop to say thank you? Most of us just walk past them without thinking. But the truth is, they play a big part in our daily comfort. We get to start our day in a clean environment because they finish their tiring work before we even begin ours. That’s something I respect a lot.I still remember one day during the rainy season — the whole corridor was muddy because everyone came in with wet shoes. It looked really messy, and I thought it would take the whole day to clean. But within a short time, the cleaning staff came and mopped everything perfectly. They kept doing it even though the floor kept getting dirty again and again. I was honestly amazed at their patience. They didn’t complain or get angry; they just quietly did their job. That day I truly realized how hardworking they are.Because of their work, we get to live and study in a clean environment. And that matters more than we realize. A clean place makes us feel calm and fresh. Our mood depends a lot on how our surroundings look and smell. When the bathrooms are clean and the corridor is fresh, it automatically makes us feel better. On the other hand, when a place is dirty, we feel irritated and tired. So in a way, the cleaning staff also help us mentally — by giving us a pleasant and positive space to live in.Their job is not easy. Cleaning bathrooms, wiping floors, carrying buckets of water — it’s all physically tiring. But they do it every single day with dedication. Sometimes I notice how they talk to each other while working, smiling and joking. Even though their work is tough, they still manage to stay cheerful. That really inspires me. It shows me that if you do your work with a good heart, even hard work feels lighter.Another thing I’ve noticed is how humble they are. They greet students politely and never show any frustration even when people make their work harder. There are times when some students don’t bother to keep things tidy, but the cleaning staff still handle it calmly. They clean everything again and again, making sure others don’t face discomfort. That kind of patience is not something everyone has.

I try to greet them whenever I see them, just a small “Good morning” or “Thank you.” It might seem like a small thing, but I feel it makes a difference. One day, I said thank you to one of the cleaning ladies after she finished mopping near my room. She smiled so warmly and said, “It’s okay, son, it’s my duty.” But I could see that she was happy that someone noticed her work. That smile stayed in my mind for a long time. It reminded me that appreciation, even a small one, means a lot.What I’ve learned from them is that no work is small or big. Every job has value. They don’t wear formal clothes or teach in classrooms, but they teach us something more important through their actions — the value of hard work and humility. They remind us that real dignity lies in doing your duty sincerely, no matter what kind of work it is.Sometimes, when I walk in a clean corridor or use a tidy bathroom, I try to remind myself that it didn’t just become clean by itself. Someone woke up early, worked hard, and made sure it looked that way. It’s so easy for us to take that for granted, but without them, college life would be very uncomfortable.They may not get awards or attention, but in reality, their role is just as important as anyone else’s. Without cleanliness, the college would not run properly. Even our health depends on the environment being clean. Because of their efforts, we are safe from infections and diseases. They protect us silently in their own way.I’ve also noticed how they care for their workspaces. Sometimes they talk about keeping the washrooms smelling fresh or using less water when cleaning. It shows how much pride they take in their work. They don’t just clean; they care. That’s something I really admire.I feel we should learn to respect them more. Just because someone’s job looks simple doesn’t mean it’s easy. They deserve appreciation, respect, and kindness from all of us. A simple smile or word of thanks can make them feel seen and valued.Whenever I feel lazy to clean my own room, I remember how they work for hours every day without complaint. It motivates me to be more responsible about my own surroundings. They have unknowingly taught me to keep things neat and organized.To me, the cleaning staff are like silent heroes of our college. They don’t seek attention, but their work keeps everything functioning smoothly. Because of them, we live in a clean and pleasant environment. Because of them, our mornings start fresh. Because of them, we don’t have to worry about hygiene. They make sure we don’t suffer, and they do it all quietly, with patience and kindness.I am truly thankful to them for everything they do. They make our college not just clean but also comfortable and welcoming. Their hard work, dedication, and kindness inspire me to be more humble and grateful in life.comfortable and welcoming.  Whenever I think of gratitude, I realize it’s not only for big things or big people. It’s also for those who do small things with big hearts. And for me, the cleaning staff in our college are a perfect example of that. They remind me every day that good work doesn’t always need recognition it just needs sincerity.So, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you to them — for their hard work, for their patience, and for making our surroundings clean and peaceful. They make our days better without even knowing it, and I will always be grateful to them for that.

SCENARIO 3
Date: During my initial hostel days
whom: My Roomates
When I first came to the hostel, I honestly didn’t know what to expect. I had never stayed away from my family for so long, and the thought of living with completely new people made me both nervous and curious. I didn’t know whether I would adjust easily or feel homesick all the time. But everything changed after I met my roommates. They turned what could have been a difficult experience into one of the happiest and most comfortable parts of my college life.I am truly thankful for my roommates because they make the hostel feel like home. Living in a hostel is very different from living at home. There is no family around to talk to, no one to make you food or wake you up in the morning. At first, it feels strange. But when you have good roommates, it feels like you’ve found a new little family. That’s exactly what my roommates are to me. They are not just the people I share a room with — they are my friends, my support system, and sometimes even like my brothers.From the first day, they made me feel comfortable. I remember when I first entered the hostel room with my luggage, feeling shy and a little lost. They greeted me with smiles, helped me arrange my things, and started talking as if we had known each other for a long time. That friendly welcome instantly made me feel relaxed. Slowly, we started sharing stories, laughing about random things, and before I realized it, we became really close.What I like the most about my roommates is how understanding they are. Everyone has different habits — someone might like to sleep early, another might stay up late, someone likes silence, another likes music — but we all adjust with each other. We respect each other’s space and try not to make anyone uncomfortable. It’s these small things that make hostel life peaceful and happy.I can share anything with them — my feelings, my worries, and my happiness. Whenever I feel confused about something, whether it’s about studies, personal life, or some small decision, they always listen and give me suggestions. Sometimes, they joke around and lighten my mood when I’m stressed. Other times, they sit seriously and help me figure things out. That balance — of fun and support is what makes them special.We have built so many memories together in our small room. Late-night talks, movie nights on one phone, eating snacks together, playing games, or just laughing at silly things — these moments make hostel life beautiful. Even when college days get busy or tiring, I know that when I go back to the room, there will be someone waiting to talk, share food, or simply sit with me in silence. That comfort means a lot.There are days when I miss my home badly. Sometimes after a long day, I feel like I just want to go back and be with my parents. But then I look around and see my roommates, and that sadness goes away. They tease me, cheer me up, and make me laugh again. In those moments, I realize that home is not always a place — it’s also the people around you who make you feel loved and cared for. My roommates are those people for me.

They also taught me many small things that I never noticed before. Living together requires patience and adjustment. We learned how to share things — from chargers and clothes to food and water bottles. We learned how to compromise, how to manage small misunderstandings, and how to care for each other when someone is not well. Sometimes, one of us might be sick, and the others take care by bringing food or medicines. It’s small acts like these that make our bond stronger.We also study together sometimes. Before exams, our room becomes half study area and half panic zone! One person explains, another makes jokes, and someone else keeps asking “what’s the syllabus again?” Even in stressful times, we somehow find a way to laugh and make it fun. That’s the beauty of having good roommates — you never feel alone, no matter how hard the situation is.Another thing I am grateful for is how supportive they are. Whenever I achieve something small, they are the first ones to celebrate with me. When I fail or feel down, they encourage me and say it’s okay, that next time will be better. It’s nice to have people who genuinely care about you without any expectations. Their support gives me confidence and strength to do better in everything.Sometimes, when I look back, I realize how lucky I am to have met them. Hostel life could have been lonely and difficult, but because of them, it became full of laughter and friendship. We have created so many memories that I know I’ll never forget — from random late-night walks to eating instant noodles together at midnight because we were all hungry. These are small things, but they are what make hostel life special.Even our fights are funny now when I think about them. Sometimes we argue over silly things like who used whose towel, or who ate the last biscuit. But no matter what, within a few minutes, we’re laughing again. These small fights and moments make our bond even stronger. It feels like living with siblings.There’s also a sense of comfort in knowing that even if I don’t say it, they understand me. Sometimes, when I’m quiet or upset, one of them will ask softly, “What happened?” or just hand me food without asking anything. That simple care means a lot. It reminds me that I’m not alone here — I have people who notice, who care, and who stand by me.I truly believe that having good roommates can completely change your hostel experience. They make the difference between feeling lonely and feeling at home. My roommates make me laugh every day. We share our problems, our dreams, and our secrets. They make even the most boring days interesting. Because of them, hostel life has become something I’ll always cherish and remember fondly.Whenever I talk to my parents on the phone, I tell them that I’m lucky because my roommates are really good people. My parents also feel relieved knowing that I’m surrounded by such caring friends. Sometimes, I even realize that I spend more time with my roommates than with anyone else. They have become a part of my daily routine, a part of my small hostel family.As I think about the future, I really hope our bond stays strong. Even when college ends and we all go our separate ways, I hope we stay in touch and keep the friendship alive. These are the kind of people who leave a permanent mark in your heart.To me, my roommates are not just friends — they are my second family. They are the reason I smile more, worry less, and feel at home even when I’m miles away from my real home. I’m genuinely thankful to them for everything — for the fun, the support, the laughter, and even the small scoldings when I forget to switch off the light.So, from the bottom of my heart, I just want to say thank you to my roommates — for making my hostel feel like home, for being there in every moment, and for being the kind of people I can always count on. I hope our bond stays this way forever, and that we continue to make countless more memories together.
