After joining Amrita I'm thank full to my friend Pranav for helping me to clear my doubts and always backs me when ever I'm at low and always helps me in any matter. Once we went to canteen then i forgot my purse then he pays for me.

I'm thank full for my FIH sir Mr Karthik Sharma Sir. I love to listen his class, his lessons and teaching style always inspires me and feels good. Because of his way of teaching we no need to study for exams cause he explains very interestingly that classes will be remembered in our mind.

What can be more better than writing for my very own SIH mentor Sir Ramguru Sir. He was our mentor and helped me and my team when ever we have doubts in hackaton. He is very funny person as well as the most angriest person if something happens. Also his MAOM Classes are alo so refreshing and really help me to stay calm and cool.
