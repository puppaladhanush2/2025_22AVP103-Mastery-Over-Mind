# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind
## Journal Record

To whom I feel grateful for:



To Ramaguru sir
I feel deeply grateful to my Mastery Over Mind teacher, Mr. Ramaguru Radhakrishnan Sir, for conducting this life-changing course that helped me reflect on gratitude, mindfulness, and the true purpose of life. Through this course, I got the beautiful opportunity to write a gratitude journal and truly look within myself.Because of this, I started thinking about all the people who have influenced my life my parents, friends, relatives, and even random strangers who have come into my life for just a moment but still left a meaningful impact. This reflection made me realize how every person we meet contributes something valuable to our journey.One of the greatest lessons I’ve learned from this course is the power of forgiveness and second chances. Sir made me understand that life is too short to hold grudges. Instead of treating those who hurt us as enemies, giving them another chance can sometimes make them realize our importance and help them grow as well. That realization changed how I view relationships and humanity.I also feel very grateful for how Ramaguru Sir listens and understands his students. When we faced issues related to Problem Solving and Algorithmic Thinking classes, he never judged us. He listened to all our reviews, concerns, and feedback with genuine patience and empathy. He treated the issue as his own and ensured our voices were heard something not every teacher does.Honestly, I sometimes envy the M.Tech students because they get more interaction with him, since their batch is smaller and more personal. But even from a distance, I feel inspired by how much care he gives to his students. If he could get to know all the B.Tech students more closely, I believe it would make our experience even more meaningful. The simple act of assigning us a gratitude journal has already made our lives better  and I feel that more interaction with him would guide us even further toward a peaceful, purposeful, and fulfilling path.I still remember his speech during the first week of orientation in Amruteswari Hall. His words left a deep impression on me. That was the moment I realized how sincere and dedicated the teaching at Amrita truly is. He spoke with such clarity and warmth that it instantly made everyone comfortable  despite our class being filled with students from different language backgrounds like Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. He made sure everyone felt included and respected, setting the tone for what Amrita stands for unity, compassion, and wisdom.Even though I may not have spoken to him personally very often, his teachings have silently shaped my thoughts and values. He has helped me reflect on why I am here, what my life’s purpose is, and what truly matters. I am thankful to Ramaguru Sir for being a guiding light  for helping me see that life is not just about high CGPAs or career goals, but about surrounding ourselves with good people, positive energy, and meaningful experiences.



To My Friend Rohit
Some friendships do not need time to grow, they simply happen and feel right from the very beginning. That is how it was with Rohit. We met during the first week of September, just after the first round of our hackathon was completed. At that time, everything was new and slightly overwhelming, but his calm and caring nature made it all feel a little lighter. In only a few months, he has become one of the most genuine souls I have known.Rohit has a heart that notices before words are spoken. Whenever I am hungry, he is always the first to see it and somehow brings me something to eat. That simple act of care means so much more than he realises. It is not just about food; it is about being cared for and seen without having to ask. He has quietly taught me the importance of food and self care. He made me realise that eating on time and taking care of myself are not small things, but signs of self respect.Every time we go to the canteen, he insists on paying. He pays for me and for Pranay too, never letting us argue about it. It is not about money, it is about the love and kindness behind his actions. The three of us me, Rohit and Pranay — have become like the chipmunks of our class. We run around everywhere together, laugh loudly, share inside jokes and support each other through everything. Around them, I feel a sense of belonging that is rare and comforting.Rohit is also the topper of our class. He scores above forty in every subject and yet remains humble and gentle. He never brags, never looks down on anyone. Instead, he motivates everyone around him to do better. He has a calm determination that inspires me. No matter how busy or tired he is, he never lets us down. He manages everything with quiet grace and maturity.One of the things that touches my heart deeply is the bond he shares with his mother. It is such a beautiful and pure relationship. He tells her everything, even the smallest parts of his day, and she listens with laughter, never with judgment. It is a connection built on honesty, trust and love. Seeing that has taught me how precious it is to have someone who listens simply to understand. I admire that bond, and sometimes even envy it, because it reflects a kind of love that is rare and sincere.Rohit has also been a guide in my life. When I let my attitude or emotions take over, he gently corrects me. He helps me manage the way I speak and react, not by scolding, but by explaining with patience. He wants me to grow, to become better. His guidance feels like that of an elder brother — someone who cares enough to tell me the truth even when it is uncomfortable.He is also thoughtful in ways that stay with you. The panda plushie he gifted me is one of the most special gifts I have ever received. It was the first one I got in my teenage years, and every time I see it, I am reminded of his kindness. That gift carries a small piece of his warmth, his friendship, and his way of making people feel loved without needing many words.What I love most about Rohit is how safe it feels to be around him. He listens without judgment, speaks with gentleness, and makes even silence feel comforting. His care is quiet but constant. He is strong, yet soft in all the right ways.



To My Friend and Class Representative – Pranay
When I think about the people who have made my journey at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham meaningful, one name stands above the rest — Pranay. We first met during the orientation week, and realizing that we were both from Chennai made everything instantly feel more familiar. That shared sense of home was where our friendship began, but what truly strengthened it were the moments we spent learning, laughing, and growing together.From the very beginning, Pranay stood out as someone who cared deeply for others. As our class representative, he carries his responsibilities with patience and sincerity. He’s the bridge between the faculty and our class  explaining things clearly, taking initiative, and making sure everyone feels heard. But beyond being a great leader, Pranay has been a truly caring friend.He’s the kind of person who goes out of his way to help. Whether it’s carrying my bag when I’m tired, reminding me to eat, or making sure I get home safely after class, he does it without hesitation. Through these small yet meaningful gestures, he’s taught me what genuine care looks like. He even made me realize how important food and health are  how we often forget to take care of ourselves when we’re busy. That simple lesson has stayed with me ever since.Our friendship grew even stronger during the Amrita Inter Hackathon, one of the most memorable experiences of our first semester. We worked as a team  brainstorming ideas, preparing the presentation, and pitching it with confidence. We even got featured in the official hackathon video, which still makes me smile every time I think about it. Although we couldn’t make it past the first round judged by a corporate analyst, the experience taught us more than any victory could have.We spent late nights at the library and Sopanam canteen, studying, rehearsing, and discussing everything from coding to life itself. Somewhere between all the serious planning sessions and the endless cups of tea, we also shared our stories including the silly and sometimes painful parts of our past love lives. We laughed so hard at how ridiculous we’d both been, realizing how much we’d grown since then. Those moments of honesty made our friendship deeper and more real.
Pranay has always had this calm, composed nature that balances my energy. When I get distracted or lose focus, he gently reminds me to stay grounded. Once, he told me to stop looking for something called “love” and instead focus on my studies and goals — words that hit me hard but helped me see things clearly. It wasn’t said to criticize, but to protect and guide me, like a true friend would.What I admire most about him is how he manages to stay strong and responsible while still being funny and lighthearted. He brings people together, makes everyone feel included, and knows how to make stressful days feel lighter. Being around him is easy  it feels safe, genuine, and full of laughter.Looking back, I realize how much his presence has shaped my experience at Amrita. From the first week to now, Pranay has been a part of almost every memory  from serious academic discussions to random late-night talks. He’s someone I can count on, someone who inspires me to be better, and someone I’m proud to call my best friend.
