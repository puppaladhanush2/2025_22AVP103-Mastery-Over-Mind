Scenario 1:I am deeply grateful to my friend Varun. When I had a fever and felt weak and tired, he didn’t leave me to manage it alone. He checked on me regularly, reminded me to take my medicines, and encouraged me to rest. Even when I didn’t feel like talking, he stayed patient and calm, just being there for me. His presence made me feel safe, supported, and cared for. It wasn’t just the help he gave, but the kindness behind it that truly touched me. I realized how valuable true friendship is. I will always appreciate Varun for this.
