## Journal Record
⁕**** My Gratitude Journal 1****
I am very grateful for a senior sister (I didn’t ask her name). It happened in August — maybe during the 2nd or 3rd week of the month. After all my classes were completed, I went to the general store to buy five notebooks for each subject. I carried only ₹200, and without knowing the price of each notebook, I had billed all five. The total came to ₹300. I didn’t have enough money, and since my friends had already gone back to the hostel and I didn’t have GPay or any other online payment option, I stood there helpless.
At that moment, a senior sister who was standing behind me asked, “Do you need cash?” I realized she was a senior from her ID card. I said, “Yeah,” and she asked, “How much do you want?” I told her ₹100. She didn’t even ask my name or my department. Without another word, she opened her purse, took out ₹100, and handed it to me. She even asked kindly, “Do you need to buy anything else?” I said, “No, that’s enough,” and also told her that I didn’t have GPay. She just smiled and said, “No problem, fine — you can return it tomorrow.”
I was honestly shocked. I had never met her before, and she had never met me, yet she trusted me completely. I paid the full amount and got my notebooks. As we both came out of the general store, I turned to her and said, “I’ll return your money tomorrow at the same place after my class ends, before 5 PM.” I asked for her mobile number, and she smiled and gave it to me.
The next day, after my classes were over, I texted her to confirm that I’d meet her at the same place near the general store before 5 PM. She replied that she would be waiting there. As I said, I went to the place, and she was waiting for me. I returned her money and thanked her again. I also asked which hostel she stayed in, and she said she was from Savithiri Bhavan. Then she told me she was from the EEE department, but in the moment, I forgot to ask her name.

I am very grateful to my senior sister, Nethra akka, from the Cyber Security (CYS) Department, who helps me by providing notes and clearing my doubts at any time without hesitation. We first met on our Convocation Day, August 8, when she helped me by giving details about the documents. After that, we became friends.
I call her daily to clear my doubts, and without any hesitation, she always attends my calls and patiently explains everything. Even if I call her many times in a day, she never once gets irritated. During my Physics CA1 exam, I didn’t have a calculator, and she helped me by providing hers. She has helped me in every possible way regarding my studies. She even sent me her notes for my curriculum, which were really useful. I feel very comfortable talking to her anytime.
Since I don’t have an elder sister, I feel like she is my own. She always motivates me and tells me that the CYS course is easy, so I don’t have to worry much. She mainly helped me during my mid-semester exam preparation days. Even though she had her main semester exams, she still took time to attend my calls and guide me. We also went to the library together, where she helped me by giving books and explaining the concepts clearly.
During my hardware exam preparation, she sent me notes, PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, and even her own handwritten notes to help me understand better. Since I am a biology student and was new to coding, she explained each and every line of the commands patiently so I could understand. All these events happened in October, during the exam preparation time.
After completing my exams, she called me and asked about my marks. I replied honestly that my grades were a bit low. She consoled me and said that during my semester exams, she would help me even more. She told me to come to the library daily so that she could explain everything in detail.
She is truly a gem in my college life. I feel so lucky to have someone like her who not only guides me in my studies but also supports and encourages me like a real sister

⁕ **My Gratitude Journal 3**
I want to thank my 4th year senior, Rubha sister, from the Cyber Security (CYS) Department, for the kind help she gave me during a time I really needed guidance. It happened during the Gokulashtami holidays, when I planned to go to my hometown, Mettur, Salem, to collect my original mark sheet from my school. I was still new to Coimbatore at that time and didn’t know much about the city, the bus routes, or even where the main bus stops  and auto stop were located.
I was standing at ettimadai bus stop, I didn’t know which bus would take me to Gandhipuram, And the bus number and its timing I asked a few neighbors but they didn’t respond me properly, and some just said they weren’t sure. Actually I had fear that I may miss the correct bus to Gandhipuram. Rubha sister came towards me. She asked me, “Are you a first-year student?” I said yes, and she asked me where I wanted to go, and I told her Salem —and I told her I need to know the busneeded to reach Gandhipuram .  she began explaining everything clearly. She told me that bus number 96 goes directly from Ettimadai to Gandhipuram and that it will comes around 4:00 PM. She also said that at other times, there are Ukkadam buses available, and from Ukkadam, I can easily get a Gandhipuram bus every 5 minutes ther will be a bus . She actually came along with me on the same bus.Even She can get down at Ukkadam  which is easy for her but, she chose to stay with me until Gandhipuram. Throughout the journey, she was asking about my studies, how I was choose the college, and my 12th marks and she told me she willl help me in studies. She even helped me carry my bag as it was heavy. When we reached Gandhipuram, she didn’t just leave me there — she walked with me all the way from the Town Bus Stop to the MOFSEL Bus Stop, where I could get the Salem bus. She even asked the bus conductor about the exact timing and confirmed that it would leave soon. She stood there with me for more than 10 minutes, making sure that bus stated safely before she left.
