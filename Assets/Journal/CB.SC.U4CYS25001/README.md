Gratitude journal :

Over the past few days, I went through one of the toughest times I can remember. I got sick with a fever that shot up to nearly 104°C. It was painful and exhausting. My body felt weak, my thoughts were cloudy, and everything around me seemed far away. Even the simplest things, like eating, getting out of bed, or taking medicine, felt impossible. But during that difficult time, something beautiful stood out: the kindness, care, and warmth of the people around me.

Today, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude for each person who helped me when I needed it most and for every small act of kindness that made a big difference.

The first person who comes to mind is **Pragadheesh**. When my fever was at its worst and I could barely move, he made sure I had everything I needed. He got me medicine, brought me food, and most importantly, kept checking on me every few hours to make sure I was okay. In those hazy, feverish hours, his presence was a huge comfort. I remember feeling too weak to think straight, yet he was there — steady, calm, and caring. Without his help and the medicines he gave me, I believe my condition could have gotten much worse.

What touched me most was not just what he did, but how he did it — with genuine concern and without expecting anything in return. He never made me feel like a burden; instead, he treated me with patience and empathy that reminded me what true friendship really means.

I also feel deep gratitude for **Arul** and **Sreekanth**. On the day the fever hit me hardest, I couldn't even get up from bed. My whole body ached, and I was too tired to go to the canteen for food. With some hesitation, I asked if they could buy me something to eat — and without a second thought, they did.

That simple act of bringing me food meant much more than just satisfying my hunger. It was a gesture of care, something that said, "We’ve got you." When you’re sick and away from home, small things like that make all the difference. I remember eating what they brought, and for the first time that day, I felt comforted — not just physically, but emotionally too.

Then there were **Shabarish**, **Sreehari**, and **Faheem**, who stood by me when things got worrying. That night, when my fever wouldn’t go down, they accompanied me to the clinic. It was already late, and they could have easily chosen to rest, but instead, they came along without hesitation. Walking to the clinic, feeling dizzy and weak, I remember how reassuring it was to have them beside me. Their presence gave me a sense of safety — the kind of comfort that comes only from friends who truly care. They waited patiently, made sure I was taken care of, and didn’t leave until everything was settled.

Next, I want to express my deep appreciation for **Pranay**. On the day of my fever, when I was heading home, he looked after me, ensuring I got back safely. Even after I returned, he helped me handle all the practical matters, especially the medical certificate, which would have been difficult for me to manage while I was recovering. His sense of responsibility and kindness made a big difference. It’s one thing to be cared for during sickness, but it’s another to have someone think ahead and take care of all the small, important details that you can’t focus on.

I also want to mention **Chunganth Srinivasan Sir**, who showed great understanding and compassion. When I told him about my illness, he immediately gave me extra time to complete my assignment. That simple act of consideration removed so much stress from my mind. His empathy reminded me that compassion can come not just from friends, but from teachers too, who understand that sometimes life gets in the way and that health must come first.

Finally, I want to give a heartfelt thanks to **Aadidevan**. Even before I fell sick, he had been a huge support academically. He spent time patiently helping me with homework and explaining concepts in **physics and maths**, especially before our exams. His way of teaching made complex topics easier to understand, and he never made me feel embarrassed for not grasping something right away. I could always count on him to break things down clearly and encourage me when I doubted myself.

During the days I was sick, I couldn’t study at all. I remember feeling anxious about falling behind, worried that I wouldn’t catch up before the exams. But Aadidevan reassured me that he’d help me once I felt better — and he did. After I recovered, he sat with me, going over what I had missed, explaining each topic patiently until I felt confident again. It’s rare to find someone who not only excels in studies but also willingly shares that knowledge with others. His kindness, patience, and willingness to help made a significant difference for me, not just academically, but emotionally too.
