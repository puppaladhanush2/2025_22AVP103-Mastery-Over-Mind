It was during the first week of August when I joined college — everything around me felt new and slightly overwhelming. I remember standing in line during the department document verification, my heart beating faster than usual. The crowd, the formalities, the seniors moving confidently from one counter to another — it was all a blur to me. That’s when I first met Netra, my senior. She smiled kindly and asked me if I needed help. That simple question brought such a wave of relief.
Netra helped me through the verification process patiently, explaining where to go and what to do next. She noticed that I looked a little lost, and instead of just pointing in a direction like many others might have done, she actually stayed beside me until everything was sorted. I remember thinking soft her voice sounded even in that noisy hall. From that day, I knew she was someone I could look up to.
As the days passed, I began to see her often in the department corridor. She always greeted me with a warm smile and would ask how I was adjusting. In the beginning, college life was confusing — new subjects, new people, and the constant feeling that I wasn’t doing enough. Whenever I talked to Netra, she made everything seem easier. She never acted superior because she was a senior; instead, she was encouraging and approachable.
There was one day in September, before our first internal assessment, when I was extremely anxious about my studies. I had been struggling to balance assignments, classes, and the sudden rush of expectations. Netra noticed it immediately and gently spoke about how she too had once felt exactly like me. She said it’s okay to not have everything figured out right away. I still remember her words — “What matters is you’re trying. 
Her words stayed with me. That evening, I went back to my hostel room and wrote down a list of small goals for myself — things I could do instead of worrying about what I couldn’t. That small talk with Netra completely changed how I viewed my college life.
Throughout the following weeks, she continued to guide me —  advising me about how to talk to professors confidently. She had this calmness about her that made me feel like things would be fine. What I admire most about Netra is that she motivates everyone around her without even realizing it. She doesn’t use big words , it’s her kindness, her gentle encouragement, and the way she genuinely listens that makes all the difference.
When I think about the early days of college, I can’t imagine going through them without her guidance.She inspired me to be the kind of senior I’d want others to have someday — patient, approachable.
I feel genuinely grateful to have met Netra that day in August. Meeting her made my transition into college life smoother, brighter, and far more comforting than I expected. She became not just a senior, but a mentor and a friend who believed in me even when I didn’t fully believe in myself.

When I think about my first semester in college, one person who stands out strongly in my memory is Srinivasan Sir, our Mathematics teacher. I remember the first few classes in August, when everything in college felt unfamiliar — the classrooms, the subjects, and the teaching style. But from the very first lecture, there was something reassuring about the way sir taught. He spoke calmly, clearly, and always made sure that everyone understood before moving on.
He never rushed through any topic. Instead, he’d patiently go step by step, checking whether we were following along. I still remember one day in September, when he was teaching vector spaces and subspaces. I was completely lost at first.Sir noticed that many of us were struggling, and instead of getting annoyed, he smiled and said, “Let’s take it slow. Mathematics is like a language — if you listen to it carefully, it will start making sense.” He then repeated the concept using simple real-life examples until it clicked.
What makes Srinivasan Sir special is not just his teaching skill, but his attitude. He never makes anyone feel less capable. Even if someone gives a wrong answer, he never discourages them. Instead, he says, “That’s a good attempt, but let’s think about it this way.” That simple habit builds so much confidence in the classroom.
During our mid-sem exams in October, I was very nervous about Maths. But every time I revised his notes, I realized how neatly and thoughtfully he had explained every topic. It felt like his teaching style was a map guiding me through the problems.He always say that you have to understand and enjoy the learning with real life and get to know how it is useful especially in programming where we use the concept of matrices.
Srinivasan Sir treats all students equally — whether we are sitting in the front row or the back, whether we are confident or shy. He gives everyone his attention. That sense of fairness makes him so respected among students. He doesn’t show partiality, and because of that, every student feels valued.
There’s a warmth in the way he interacts with us — soft-spoken but firm when needed. He reminds me that being a teacher is not just about delivering content but shaping how students feel about learning itself. His classroom feels like a safe space where we can ask, make mistakes, and grow. i get excited whenever there is maths class because i know that his class will not make us confused and demotivated about his subject and gives us some confidence to solve more problems in a particular chapter or topic. He also gives a complete guidance on what we should learn after the class and also informs us about the topics he completed and the topics to be completed . His class feels like i am in my school because he tells each and everything like we are guided in the school , contradicting college life since in college not everything will be said in the class , we have to do everything by ourselves . He changed my whole perspective about academics and life.
I’m deeply grateful for having a teacher like him in my very first semester. His patience, his clarity, and his belief that every student can understand if given the right explanation — all of this has made me more confident in maths and even in myself. I hope I never forget the lessons I’ve learned from him, both academic and personal.

When I first came to college in August, I was excited but also a little homesick. Adjusting to a new environment, living away from family, and meeting so many new people was not easy. But then I met Hema, my roommate — and slowly, everything began to feel like home again.
From the very first day, she was warm and friendly. She had this calm energy that made me instantly comfortable. I’m a bit talkative, and sometimes I worry that I speak too much, but Hema never makes me feel like I’m being too much. She listens to all my random thoughts, stories, and worries — about classes, about my fears, and even about silly things — with genuine interest. She doesn’t judge, she just listens and smiles.
I remember one particular night in September, before our mid-sems, when I was completely stressed out. I kept roaming around the room, complaining that I’d fail and i could not focus. she said I always overthink, but somehow i would manage.” That small sentence made me laugh and feel lighter instantly.
We share everything — our snacks, our worries, and even our dreams about what we want to do in the future. On weekends, we sometimes stay up late, talking about our families or just watching movie or listening songs together. Those little moments have become some of my favorite memories of college life.
whenever i feel sad or worried about something she does not console me that feels dramatic .. but she casually talks like we usually do .
Having a roommate like her has made me realize how important small acts of kindness are. She doesn’t have to do big things — even her patience when I’m being moody or her jokes when I’m tired make everything better. I’m genuinely grateful that I got her as my roommate because she’s not just someone I share a room with; she’s become a close friend and a safe space for me.I have never worried about how she will judge me ,so i always feel comfortable in sharing with her everything that i couldn't with my family .
When I look back at the last few months — from August to October — I can’t imagine college without her laughter and calmness. I’ve learned from Hema that friendship isn’t about constant excitement or grand gestures; it’s about being there, quietly, consistently, and with care.
I’m truly thankful that I met her. She’s made hostel life not just bearable, but beautiful.
There are other people who i am truly grateful for the little things they have done for me  but these three people came to my mind immediately when i thought of writing gratitude journal.
