# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind



## Journal Record

Throughout my short journey in Amrita of about 4 months i have encountered a lot of people who have taught me lot of important values and made me realise multiple
things about me, but from those people there are 3 people who struck me the most.

sri hari: I am really greatfull that i got him as my friend. I truely admire his intrest towards fitness and health. He is someone that i always look upto
and when it comes to body form. Spending time with him i realised that it is really important to take care of both our health and mind equally. I have been
able to realise that sitting with a book 24/7 alone won't help you achive great heights , a good fitness is nessasary to maintain our energy and gain respect throught our 
success journey.

srinivasan sir:I want to express gratitude for My Maths teacher because when I think about dedication and good care for students,my Maths sir immediately comes to mind.
His commitment to helping us understand every concept no matter how complex and no matter how many times we ask doubts truly inspires me. He is very patient and listens 
to our doubts regardless of how many times we ask it, this patience is what i aim to develop within myself.

pranay: I am really grateful that i got him as my friend . He is one of those guys who always stays chill no matter what. Deadlines, assignments ,exams around him but he 
just stays chill. But behind that clam attitude he is a very dedicated and responsible person. He just completes all his tasks on time without making it look stressfull.
His presence has made this journey more enjoyable even in tough situations.
