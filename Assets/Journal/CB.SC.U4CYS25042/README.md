## Journal Record
harshath (senior):
on 18/10/25 ,i was very low and stressed about my performance in midsem . my senior stepped and advised me to not to worry and start focusing on remaining exams. i was having a self doubt that will i make it in the sems and he motivated and i came out of that situation and had a clarity. I'm grateful to my senior as if he didn't advised that day then other exams also would be gone 
2 Saurabh sir:
on first day first class and when i saw the saurabh sir teaching i had a confidence that i can also develop myself in cse domain as i dont have that much idea in my school days or before joining amrita.I'm grateful to saurabh sir as his teaching was on point.
