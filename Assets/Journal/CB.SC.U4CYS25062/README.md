Topic:Three people I am grateful to have met in college

1. My Friend: Divyendra
I am truly grateful to have met my friend Divyendra during my college life. He has been my roommate and one of my closest companions in college. His friendly and joyful nature makes every day more cheerful and positive. Whenever I felt stressed or demotivated, he was always there to lift my spirits. His constant encouragement and positive attitude helped me regain confidence and stay focused on my goals. I have learned from him the importance of staying happy and spreading positivity even in difficult situations. I will always remember his inspiring words that keep motivating me to move forward in life.

2. My Professor: Srinivasan Sir (Mathematics)
I am deeply thankful to Srinivasan Sir, my mathematics professor, for his invaluable guidance and support throughout my college journey. He is not only an excellent teacher who made mathematics easier to understand but also a great mentor who encouraged us to develop our overall personality. His motivational talks often inspired me to dream big and work hard to achieve success in life. Apart from teaching academic subjects, he also emphasized the importance of communication skills, discipline, and self-confidence. His words of wisdom and practical lessons have had a lasting impact on my outlook toward education and personal growth.

3. My Friend: Pravin
I am also grateful to have my old school friend Pravin studying with me again in the same college, even though we are in different groups. Having a familiar face from school has made my college life more comfortable and enjoyable. Pravin is a very supportive and knowledgeable person who is always ready to help me whenever I face difficulties. He often teaches me new things and shares useful information that helps me improve both academically and personally. I truly appreciate his friendship, sincerity, and willingness to see others succeed. His presence reminds me of the value of long-lasting friendships built on trust and understanding.
