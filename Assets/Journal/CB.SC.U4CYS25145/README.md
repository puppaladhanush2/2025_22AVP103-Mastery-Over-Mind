# 22AVP103 - Mastery Over Mind


## Journal Record

SCENARIO-1
DATE- 2  MONTH AGO
I remember how everything felt new and overwhelming when I joined Amrita University for the first time: a huge campus, unfamiliar faces, new routines, and a syllabus that looked far tougher than anything I had faced before. An excited yet nervous fresher, I often used to wonder how I would handle everything from academics to hostel life during those confusing early days. One person did make a huge difference in my journey, and that was my senior, Prajith.

I am really grateful to him, not only because he is a senior but for being a true guide and friend. He helped me adjust to college life and gave me the confidence to study challenging subjects; he treated me like his younger brother right from the start.

I still remember the first time I met Prajith anna during the initial orientation week. I was standing near the main block, holding my schedule in confusion, not sure which lab to go to. He noticed me struggling, walked up with a friendly smile, and said, “First year, right?” I nodded, and he instantly offered to help.

That was the beginning of a bond that would later mean so much to me. He patiently explained how to get through the campus, which professors were strict, how internal marks worked, and even shared small tips on balancing classes and hostel life. For a newcomer like me, those small pieces of advice made a big difference.

It’s easy to feel lost during the first few weeks of college, but with seniors like him around, everything slowly started making sense. He told me that the first semester is all about setting a strong base — not just academically, but mentally.

One thing that really helped me during those days was the academic support he gave. When I faced difficulties with some subjects, such as programming and discrete mathematics, he was always there to help. I still remember that one evening in the hostel common room-I had my C programming assignment in front of me and I was getting nowhere regarding the concepts of loops and conditions.

He noticed and sat beside me. Instead of just giving me the answers, he explained the logic step by step. His way of teaching was simple, patient, and clear. He said, “Once you understand the concept, Sanjay, you’ll start enjoying coding. Don’t just memorize the syntax — try to think like the computer.”

That one line completely changed the way I approached my studies. Everything that then seemed to be a burden appeared as a kind of puzzle that was waiting to be solved.

He also shared his old notes, which became my lifeline during exams. Those notes weren't just summaries; they were full of small tips, examples, and handwritten explanations that made tough topics easy. Whenever I would read them, I could feel how much he had worked hard to learn and how selflessly he was sharing that effort just to help me.

There were times when I felt low, especially before my first internal exams. I used to think I wasn’t smart enough to handle the CSE subjects. During one of those moments, Prajith asked what was wrong since he realized that I had been silent. I told him honestly how I was not capable of managing everything: pressure, expectations, and tough subjects.

He listened quietly, then smiled and said something I’ll never forget:

“Everyone feels that way in the beginning, Machan. The difference is whether you give up or grow through it. You're smarter than you think — you just need to trust yourself a bit more.”

That conversation changed my attitude completely. From that day, I started believing that struggle was normal and temporary. He made me realize that college is not about being perfect; it's about learning, making mistakes, and improving slowly.

He even taught me how to plan my study schedule, dividing topics into small goals rather than trying to do everything at once. That practical advice helped me stay organized and reduced my stress a lot. What I really respect about Prajith is that he didn't just focus on helping me with academics but guided me in shaping my overall mindset. He always said that as cybersecurity students, we should develop curiosity beyond textbooks. He encouraged me to read about ethical hacking, attend workshops, and try small online projects even if I failed initially.

He narrated stories of how he once struggled with the same subjects, yet through all the consistent practice, he improved. His story made me realize that nobody gets good overnight; it takes patience, effort, and belief.

I remember a weekend where he invited a few of the juniors to his room and had a small, informal session on “Basic Cybersecurity Tools.” He showed us how cyber attacks work in real life and how ethical hackers defend systems. That session opened my eyes; it made me realize how exciting and impacting this field is.

After that day, my interest in cybersecurity doubled. I started experimenting with tools and learning from him whenever I could. He made me feel that learning can be fun and meaningful if we truly enjoy what we do. More than a guide, Prajith became like an elder brother to me. He'd always ask me if I was eating properly, sleeping well, and adjusting to hostel life. If I fell sick, he'd bring me medicines or food from the mess. Small acts of care showed how genuine he was. He never made me feel like a junior; he treated me with respect and kindness. He once said, “You’ll have many teachers in life, Sanjay, but good seniors are rare — so when you become one, remember to help your juniors too.” That line struck a chord with me: that the goodness we receive should always be passed forward. As time went by, I could see the change in me due to his influence. I wasn't that nervous fresher full of self-doubts. I started participating in small coding events and discussions. And whenever I'd achieve something, he was the first one I'd tell, who would respond with a simple "Proud of you, Machan" - words that meant so much to me. Not even when I failed or did something wrong would he ever scold or find it funny. Instead, he'd say, "Good, now you know what not to do." His positive outlook showed me to look at failures as lessons and not as roadblocks. Rarely do you find people who would guide you without expecting anything in return; Prajith is one of those, full of humility, patience, and a good heart.

SCENARIO-2
DATE- 1.5 MONTHS AGO
When I think about my college life so far, the first thing that comes to my mind is not just the classes or the subjects; it's the people who make every day brighter. Among them, one person stands out the most-my close friend, **Ashwanth**.

Without him, college life just wouldn't be the same. Since the very first semester, he has been somebody I could count on with anything: to share notes, to help me out with assignments, or simply to make me laugh after a long and tiring day. He has been my all-around support, both academically and personally.

We have shared moments of stress, sleepless nights before exams, funny incidents in class, and endless laughter over the smallest of things. Those little moments, which might seem ordinary to others, are what make my college life really special.

I am so grateful for the bond we've had, one which has reminded me time and again that true friendship is not about being perfect; it's about showing up in everything for one another, never judgmental and with no conditions.

I still remember the first time I met **Ashwanth**. It was during the first week of college, when everything felt unfamiliar and a bit chaotic. I was sitting quietly in the classroom, wondering who to talk to, and then he turned around, smiled, and asked, “Hey, what’s your name, bro?” That small friendly gesture was enough to break the ice.

In minutes, we were laughing at how confused the timetable looked and how both of us got lost en route to the lab. That day marked the beginning of a friendship that has only grown stronger with time.

Days passed, and we started sitting together in class, working on assignments side by side, and helping each other understand new topics. Whenever I didn't get something, Ashwanth would explain it patiently, often adding his funny examples to make it more interesting. His way of teaching and his easy nature made even tough subjects look manageable.

Ups and downs are there for each and every student throughout college, and at times it feels like it is just too much to handle. In those moments, **Ashwanth** has always been there for me.

Whenever he'd say, *“Machan, don’t stress. Let’s take one topic at a time — we’ll manage.”*, before exams when the pressure would start getting to me and I would doubt myself, somehow he'd always manage to get me out of that phase.

There were nights of staying up late in the hostel, revising for tests and explaining topics to each other. We would sit with our laptops open, empty coffee cups on the side, half-focused on the syllabus but still joking about how little we studied. Those nights were chaotic but unforgettable-memories that make you smile later on.

He's the kind of friend who shares everything: from notes and study materials to snacks and advice. Whenever I had missed a class, he'd always send me the notes before I even asked. When I got low marks in a test, he’d say, *“Chill, da. Next one we’ll kill it together.”* That positive attitude is one of the many reasons I admire him.

He doesn't compete, he collaborates. And that is what makes our friendship so special.

It's not just about the studies. What makes my friendship with **Ashwanth** truly special is the small moments that bring so much joy to everyday life.

We have enjoyed many laughs over silly things, such as our combined confusion during the programming lab or when one of us finally found the typo that was breaking the whole code. Sometimes, even a single inside joke makes the day much brighter.

One of my favorite memories is when we both decided to present a small project in class. We were both nervous, but we kept on encouraging each other and practicing together. We messed up a few points during the presentation, but it didn't matter, as we were laughing at it afterward and calling it a “learning experience.”

After long classes, we would often go for evening tea near the canteen, talking about everything-from our dreams and goals to random jokes that made no sense. Those small conversations, though simple, made me realize how important it is to have someone who truly understands you.


College can feel quite heavy at times-deadlines, pressure, and expectations. Still, with a friend like **Ashwanth**, one manages the worst of days.

One of the best things about **Ashwanth** is his attitude towards life. He's always positive, even when things don't go his way. I have seen him handle failures with a smile and keep moving forward. That quality inspires me every day.

He has this habit of encouraging everyone around him. If somebody is down, he will go all the way out to help. His forthrightness in kindness distinguishes him from the rest. He once said to me, *"We all rise when we lift others."* That line stuck in my head because that was really indicative of him: a person who believes in helping rather than competing.

When I joined college, I used to be shy about talking to people or asking doubts in class. But **Ashwanth** helped me come out of my shell. He would push me gently to participate, remind me that mistakes are part of learning, and motivate me to give my best. Over time, I noticed how much I had changed — more confident, more open, and more focused — and I owe a big part of that to him.

What I cherish most is that our friendship isn't limited to academics or college. It goes beyond that.

We celebrated birthdays together, took short trips around Coimbatore, and shared meals that became hours of laughter. And when it got really tough-when one or the other missed home, or just felt too stressed-we'd be there for each other. There is a saying: *“College friends become your family.”* For me, **Ashwanth** is the proof of that statement. He is like a brother, someone whom I can trust, respect, and talk with about anything in front of him. He's seen me at my best and my worst, and yet never judged me. That's the kind of friendship that lasts a lifetime.

SCENARIO-3
DATE-1 MONTHS AGO
Mathematics has always been that one subject that excites and instills fear within a student at the same time. It's logical, precise, and beautiful once understood, but challenging when it seems abstract. During my time at Amrita University, there has been one person who completely changed the way I look at Mathematics — **Dr. Chungath Srinivasan**, my Mathematics professor.

It is his patience, clarity, and style of teaching that have deeply affected the way I learn and approach any complex topics. The thing that makes him truly remarkable, though, is not his knowledge, but how he is able to take each concept and make it understandable and meaningful, even to students who previously struggled with the subject.

He taught one of the most difficult topics in our syllabus this week-a topic that appeared to be quite daunting at first-but the way he explained it made it sound so simple and even interesting. I am truly thankful for his commitment to making a difference in my learning life.

I still remember the first class I attended by **Dr. Chungath Srinivasan**. It was the beginning of the semester, and the classroom was filled with fresh energy and curiosity. He walked in with a calm presence, greeted us with a warm smile, and began his lecture in a way that instantly caught everyone's attention.


Unlike some professors who rush through formulas and definitions, he started with simple real-life analogies, explaining how Mathematics is not just about numbers — it’s a way of thinking logically and solving real-world problems.

He was so approachable from the very first day in class when he encouraged us to ask questions anytime, saying, *“No question is silly if it helps you understand better.”* That sentence itself brought down a lot of fear for many students. He made the classroom a safe place, and for him, learning was not about mugging up formulas but creating an understanding of the concepts.


One thing that I deeply appreciate about **Dr. Chungath Srinivasan** is his patience. Without hesitation, he explains a topic over and over again, until every student is confident in it. If the whole class becomes silent or if nobody puts forward any doubts, he will take that as a possible indication that some person has not understood it and calmly explains it again in another way.

Mathematics, particularly further on in college, is often about building on previously explained concepts. If one step isn't clear, the following one becomes more difficult. He understands this perfectly, and instead of rushing through, he makes sure the foundation is clear.

For example, in one lecture on *Linear Transformations*, arguably one of the more abstract topics that we came across, many of us seemed lost. He sensed our confusion, paused, smiled, and said, “Alright, let’s take a step back.” He then drew a very simple diagram, connecting the concept to something as basic as coordinate shifts we'd learned earlier. Within minutes, things started clicking.

That day, I realized how powerful a good teacher's patience can be. He made something complicated look simple by breaking it down logically and explaining it at a pace that everyone could follow.


This week, he took up one of the most difficult topics in our syllabus: *Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors.* Many of us were apprehensive because we knew it was a very tough topic. His teaching turned that fear into curiosity.

He introduced the subject by connecting it to a real example, explaining how these concepts apply in computer graphics and cybersecurity, and my attention was caught at once. Then, step by step, he built up the theory, connecting it to what we knew.

The amazing thing was the way he preempted our doubts, as if even before one of us could ask them. If he saw a few scrunched-up faces, he would smile and say, “I can see a few eyebrows raised. Let’s simplify this part.” He'd then rephrase it, sometimes even using humor to lighten up the atmosphere.

By the end of the lecture, I was surprised at how much I had understood. A topic that seemed impossible a day before now felt logical and approachable. I walked out of class that day with genuine appreciation and a sense of confidence that I hadn’t felt before in Mathematics.


His effort, along with his patience and thorough explanations, made the greatest difference: not only in understanding the topic but also in my attitude toward learning difficult concepts.

Another thing I admire about **Dr. Srinivasan** is that he always motivates students in his classes to speak up, share ideas, and clarify their doubts without any hesitation. He keeps reminding us, *"The more you ask, the more you understand."*

I've noticed that even when someone makes a mistake answering a question, he never dismisses it. Instead, he says something like, "That's an interesting thought — let's see where that leads." This positive approach creates an environment where we're not afraid to try.

There was one instance where I answered a problem incorrectly. Instead of just saying that, he explained to me why my method didn't work and how I should approach it. That small gesture helped not only in understanding the problem better but also boosted my confidence. It made me realize that mistakes are just stepping stones to learning.

Many students consider Mathematics to be a subject that's either "easy for some" or "impossible for others." But **Dr. Srinivasan** breaks that stereotype. He says that anyone can understand Math, if it's taught properly and patiently. His enthusiasm for the subject is palpable in every lecture. Never does he simply read from the textbook but brings in his own examples to illustrate the points, connects theory with practical applications, and explains why each concept is important. That makes a huge difference. Sometimes, while going home after class, I realize just how lucky we all are to have this kind of teacher: one who does not teach just for the sake of teaching but one who truly desires that his students learn and progress. His commitment reminds me that teaching is not simply a profession; it is a form of service.
